AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT 12-Core 3.8 GHz Socket AM4 105W 100-100000277WOF Desktop Processor,2163.0,5,479.0,James D.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,9/16/19 10:53,5.0,"Pros: -fast
-doubled my core/thread count from my 4790k, staggering performance leap in multi core apps, decent improvement in single core.
-relatively cheap for the performance
-ABBA bios has sorted out voltage, temperature, fan noise, and most importantly...boost clocks.
Cons: -PBO settings can be a little confusing, but i've been on Intel since my last AMD CPU, an athlon x2 3600.
-AM4 mounting bracket.....ARRRRRGH
Overall Review: I've waited a long time for a chip worthy to replace my 4790k. And I've waited a REALLY long time for AMD to come out with a challenger. This chip is it.
I have (and never had) any temperature issues using stock cooler (with stock TIM), and I have it in a NZXT H510, on top of an Aorus GTX 1080ti. So, I don't really understand why people are having so many temperature issues. The mounting bracket is a PAIN, so maybe TIM is being messed up during installation. Who knows? All I know is that my idle temp is lower with stock cooler than my 4790k at 4.6 was with an H90 AIO. Load temps are almost identical. So, the cooler works very well. If not, you either got a dud chip (RMA) or you're simply doing it wrong.
The ABBA bios released recently has upped my boost clock to 4.45 on 3 cores, and 5 cores are within 30mhz of 4.4, whereas previous bios release only 1 or 2 cores boosted anywhere over 4.3, so big big improvement there. It also smooths out the fan ramping up/down, which indeed was somewhat annoying. It also stabilized my voltages, thereby giving me more stable temps.
I agree with a prior poster...just about EVERYONE told me that i would see virtually no improvement over my 4790k at 3440x1440p 100hz. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG. BF5 was pegging my CPU, and my 1080ti was at 65-90ish% usage. Now, cpu is like 35% and my 1080ti is 99% in-game. BIG difference in my minimum frames and the stability of my frame rate.
I expect this CPU will last me for at least 5 years before I get the upgrade bug (again)...at which point i can step into a 3950x or maybe even a 4000 series (depends on whether socket stays the same, obviously). Unless Intel answers with a stunner in the next few years. I'll support the superior product, regardless of the label on the box. And this CPU is superior to anything Intel at similar costs, and lines up closely with their flagship 9900k, for the most part, at roughly 70% of the cost. Add to that the efficiency, and it's a slam dunk.
All in all, i ABSOLUTELY think this is a worthy successor to my trusty and loved 4790k, which served me so well for many years. And I, for one, am glad to be sporting an AMD chip again. If you're in the same boat, I don't think you will be disappointed. I'm not.

Overall Review: Coming from Intel i7, I wasnt sure about going with AMD. My Intel lasted me 8 yrs overclocked at 4.6ghz. But Surprise! This is a great gaming CPU! I dont even see the need to OC this thing. It chews up and spits out everything thrown at it thus far. Stays cool even in turbo, and while gaming.

Overall Review: I think my use case is a little unusual as I'm not a gamer and bought the 3900x for development on Linux. Previously, I was using a system with a (non-hyperthreaded) 6-core Phenom II 1075T. My plan was to wait to upgrade until a CPU came out that would more than double my performance. Well, mission accomplished. My builds now take 1/3rd as much time. They'd run even faster but there's a few points during compilation where the build I do is single-threaded. My system consists of a 3900x on a Gigabyte X570 AORUS ELITE x570 motherboard. I'm using 3200 Mhz CL16 RAM with a GTX 1050ti I got from E-bay. So, clearly not a gaming rig but I didn't want or need that. I'm using CentOS 7.6 because that's what I need to run the builds and that installed without a hitch. Overall, completely satisfied. Just a word of caution on the Aorus Elite motherboard that the shipped BIOS is a little buggy and you'll want to upgrade it immediately. Also, I couldn't get XMP to work until I switch from the ""easy"" to ""advanced"" mode in the BIOS. Not a big deal.",0.0,14.0,15.0,3.0,4.0,1,0,1

Overall Review: About every 10 years I get the itch to build a desktop from parts. From 1Ghz AMD Thunderbirds to my last build using an AMD Phenom II black edition, I have been using AMD CPU's for my desktop builds. They just work and have so far each lasted 10 years of overclocked 24/7 ontime usage. This new Ryzen 7 3700X is almost on par with my Intel I9 9900 that I have in an Area51 Laptop. It actually beats it in Cinebench R20. This thing is flying through my video encoding and staying quite cool with a Corsair 115I AIO liquid cooler. I was going to use the included wraith prism cooler as it gets good reviews, but my ram is too tall and too close to it. I am glad to see AMD back competitively with Intel.

- For objective reviews of this processor, see professional reviews elsewhere online
Cons: - None.
Overall Review: This review is subjective, for an objective review you can see the hundreds of professional reviews for this processor.

Why would you ever need a 12 cores with 24 logical threads?
This processor has allowed me to combined 3 PCs into 1, which has dramatically cut down on my I.T. management of disparate systems. I used to have a dedicated PC for gaming/compiling, a dedicated PC for video surveillance, and a dedicated HTPC for streaming and archival management. I now do all 3 in 1 without any performance degradation while also enjoying a speed boost because each of these tasks gets a few more logical cores to utilize.

I'm very happy with this processor, I've been holding off upgrading for a long time because my 3770K has been an amazing CPU (and is still amazing). The 3900X is the first CPU which has checked all of the boxes that gave me justification for an upgrade.",0.0,12.0,13.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Much better value than other options, including within AMD's offerings too, especially if you're not into heavy video editing or content creation.

Running this chip with a MSI X470 Carbon Motherboard, 8 GB worth of G-Skill Blinged-Out Ram, and an RTX 2080. Did plenty of research before I upgraded and everyone online was saying it won’t make a difference at 1440p (or 4k) and that the GPU is the bottleneck in those cases. I can tell you right now that none of those folks know what the heck they are talking about. I gained 15-25 FPS in my game of choice by just replacing the 1600x with the 3700x.

I play racing games and love to look at the replays afterwards. During replays things were getting choppy with the 1600x dropping down to 40fps during some heavy action. I saved one of the replays to use as an fps test to use with FRAPS to log the min, max, and avg FPS. Min was 42, max was 98, avg was 55. By just installing the chip the min went to 59 fps, max went to 117 and the avg was 69. This chip turned a choppy experience into a smooth one but according to the internet it shouldn’t make a difference. Don’t listen to them. I’m running 3440 X 1440p which is ¾ of 4k and more pixels than the standard 2560X1440p which folks said it wouldn’t matter. Smh

One more thing, CPU-Z reports a clock of 4.2** (it fluctuates) GHZ out of the box. My R5 1600x wouldn't even overclock to 4.0GHZ",0.0,12.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,0,0,1

12 threads are more than enough for most workloads.
Excellent IPC means it has more processing power per Hz than most if not all Intel chips currently available.
Excellent power consumption for the performance.
Cons: Although really negligible, boost clocks falls slightly short of what I expected.
PBO doesn't really overclock or increase performance.
In a sense, the biggest con could be that this CPU's specifications are right on the limits, and, even though unlocked there is nothing to be gained by overclocking (except instability and more power consumption).
Overall Review: For many years my overclocked Intel 2600K kept up with modern gaming and light workloads, and at first I was hesitant to upgrade to the Ryzen 3600, however I am more than pleased and blown away by the performance increase, which is much more than I expected.
My Cinebench R20 scores on the 2600K were 1768 / 356 @ 4.8 Ghz (!) and on the Ryzen 3600 (stock) it is 3627 / 483.
I would 10/10 buy this again, purely because it is the best bang for buck processor on the market right now and you can't go wrong with it, no matter what you intend to use it for.",0.0,12.0,12.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I was an early adopter of the Ryzen 1000 series, which came with its setbacks, however the 1700 I had been using for a couple of years proved to be a great CPU. The 3000 series with its 50% die shrink was very attractive and being compatible with older AM4 boards like mine made this purchase a no-brainer. Great performance at a good price point and doesn't really need an OC to be competitive with processors that are priced higher.

Inexpensive compared to performance.
Compatible with my music production and video editing software.
Bundled fan is just fine for cooling, looks great, and comes with thermal paste pre-installed.
Cons: Can really heat up if you're not using a good case, good fans, and being smart about your power management.
Overall Review: It's no secret the chip can get hot.
To decrease this issue I did the following things:

Bought a very strong power supply so it never over draws juice (EVGA 750w gold)

Bought a motherboard with plenty of built in heatsinks and fan connectors (msi 570 unify)

A case with great airflow that came with fans (fractal meshify c)

Some extra fans (Corsair fans that light up blue, to calm down the processor)

Set my large fans (140mm) at top of case by CPU fan to pull hot air out and away as fast as I can.

Finally (if you want to keep idle temps in the 30's and mild working temps in the 40's) then go into your power plan settings in windows and set the minimum CPU power draw to 1-3% and the maximum to 99%. This prevents the darn thing from ""power boosting"" and jumping up and down 10 degrees in temp as so many people report.

Overall? Yes ,I highly recommend this chip. It does need a little tlc to get up and going, but once it does it is a beast.

I can just chew through music production and video editing with this thing. Heck, my old laptop would buckle, scratch, and pop if I loaded too many plug-ins into my saw (mixcraft 9), but this thing can run 30 tracks with reverbs, compressord, eqs and only hit 1-3% CPU usage.

Just insane.

Also, the included fan is just fine, you don't need anything better. If you buy expensive cooling and do all the things I recommend, you maybe save a few degrees of temp, so not with it.

Plus, included cooler looks really cool with rgb",0.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Sadly, my last build was I-2700k and it was way past time for an upgrade. I'm not a gamer anymore so I cant speak to how it performs in that aspect. I won't sit here and talk about overclocking, temps and all that stuff. There's plenty of reviews like that on here already. What I will talk about is from a work station stance, it's night and day. My 3D rendering times have dropped from 30-40 minutes to 2-4 minutes! That savings just in time is worth the price of admission. I didn't buy the best/fastest because I don't need to.

On the Monday before Thanksgiving (2019-11-25) NewEgg is out of stock on Ryzen 7 CPU's. Sorry for all of you that want one.
Overall Review: I replaced the motherboard/CPU in my PC about 3 months ago. I did have an AS Rock MB X370 Killer and an Ryzen 5 1600 Gen 1 CPU.

I upgraded to an AS Rock RX 570 Steel Legend MB and a Ryzen 7 3800X CPU and it's a lot faster now.

I also installed a Samsung 860 Evo M2 drive, and I could never get the MB/system to recognize it. Even after updating the BIOS.

So I finally went to the AS Rock site, downloaded a list of M2 drives they said would work, and when NewEgg put one on sale I bought it (Intel SSDPEKNW512G8) and swapped it for the Evo. That worked.

Then I used EaseUS to clone my Win10 environment over to the M2 drive, and now I'm running Windows off of the M2 drive.

So if you try something like this, make sure you get an M2 drive that's compatible with your MB.

The Ryzen 3800X works great, runs cool with the included cooler, and it puts on a light show for you, even when the PC is off.

AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT 12-Core 3.8 GHz Socket AM4 105W 100-100000277WOF Desktop Processor,2163.0,5,479.0,Adam S.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,10/11/19 16:20,5.0,"Pros: - Blistering benchmarks
- Solid temperatures with premium (third-party) air cooler
- Performance / cost is exceptional
Cons: - I have only seen the 4.6 GHz boost one time on Core #0. (See overall review)
- Default voltage requests from this processor are large.
- Precision Boost 2 vs Precision Boost Overdrive.
Overall Review: It has been nearly 20 years since I ventured into the AMD market. The Ryzen 9 is an incredible processor, especially for the cost. I think this is evidenced by the consumer demand, but let me talk a bit about my performance experience. I paired this processor with arguably the best air cooler on the market, and the CPU sits at 39-40C idle with the die temperatures being reported at 34C. Under full load stress testing, my processor maxed at 60C, which is essentially the same as my previous build. Thus, despite external concerns regarding the TDP of the 3900X, I find no anomalous issue in this department.

My experimentation with voltages, however, left me far more confused and concerned. Out of the box, the default vcore of my new build was set to 1.48V. This is, in my opinion, obnoxiously high and sits well above what I understand to be safe for silicon. Sure enough, if I look at VIDs, I find that the CPU is still requesting voltages that high. I set a voltage offset of -0.1V in my motherboard bios. At this value, I actually found a benchmark maximum, and my average vcore during an uptime cycle now sits at a far more comforting 1.227V.

4.6 GHz appears to be a promised land with the Ryzen 9. I only hit that value once, during one benchmark test, on Core #0. My typical frequency maxes during an uptime cycle are [4.53, 4.50, 4.50, 4.48, 4.53, 4.48, 4.35, 4.33, 4.35, 4, 33, 4.35, 4.35] GHz across the 12 cores. With my voltage offset shown above, my typical base level clock sits at 3.6GHz instead of 3.8, but that is my choice. Under a full load benchmark test, I tend to see 4.1-4.2 GHz across all cores. Some might view this as a con, but for context, my CPU is still putting up incredibly strong benchmark numbers. I have also avoided using Precision Boost Overdrive, as global research has shown it to not be significantly more effective than just leaving things up to Precision Boost 2. AMD should have probably come up with more distinct naming conventions as PB2 is merely a stock boosting processor feature, whereas PBO falls into the realm of ""defined as overclocking"" and is not considered ""in-spec"".

It would really be nice to see a comment from AMD clarifying the voltage issues I described above. I've found a lot of discussion on that particular topic, but all of the listed 'facts' appear to simply be conjecture and opinion. Any AMD tech around here? Maybe drop me a comment? Save the day? ;)

Overall, I have found my Ryzen 9 experience to be incredibly enjoyable thus far. For an enthusiast with knowledge of how to build and setup a computer, every concern I just listed could be easily addressed. Frankly, at the time of writing this review, there is just no other processor on the market that can do what the 3900X is doing -- especially at this price point. It is certainly worth a serious look by those in need of a CPU -- including from those who have been flying a different colored flag for quite sometime.",0.0,7.0,7.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

-Easy to install
-Lower power consumption compared to first generation*
-Cooler running compared to first generation*
-Faster running than the first Generation*
-Zen Architecture!
-RGB Setup for boards that don't support RGB through USB header
- Multi-pipe Heatsink (Wraith Prism cooler)
Cons: -If boost is on, engages the boost constantly causing high power consumption and high heat generation (Solved by turning off boost in Bios. This is an issue that AMD says is being looked into and is across all 3rd Gen currently...)

-The heat sink (Wraith Prism cooler) is not completely flat on the base that contacts the chip. While not entirely an issue, for those using their own heat transfer compound such as Arctic Silver it complicates the application as they have to not only apply it to the chip surface but now fill the grooves on the heatsink properly and smooth them out properly or there won't be appropriate cooling... (a real pain in the rear end!)
Overall Review: I knocked an egg off only due to the on going issue with the Boost running too frequently causing excessive power usage and heat along with the design of the Wraith Prism cooler heatsink not being completely smooth across the bottom making it a pain if applying your own heatsink compound.

Outside of the above mentioned, The Ryzen 7 3700x is an impressive improvement over my previous Ryzen 7 1700! Nearly twice the processor flat bench tests and thanks to the new 3rd generation board that I installed with this new processor, the Asus ROG Strix X570-F, the processor is able to work at it's fullest!

To give insight on the first mentioned issue. With the boost off, the CPU runs with a constant idle temperature of 38c. With Boost on, the constant idle temp moves up to a constant 62c. No change in programs running. No additional windows open. This is obviously an issue. The previous Ryzen 1700 Idle was 41c and with boost was only 44c. There WAS an increase, but only a couple degrees... not nearly 25... so I feel an egg drop is in order until this issue is resolved even though this, from what I've read, is a generation issue.

The Wraith Prism cooler, it is a quiet running cooler. Just as quiet as the previous Spire was on the Ryzen 1700. The only time I've ever heard either kick up was when they were maxed but then it is hard to tell if it was the Wraith or Spire making the noise or all the other fans kicking up when the system was being pressed. When pushing the fan to max while using software, and the case is closed, the fan can be heard but only softly to me. This may be due to the case I have, which IS a sold case but it is a steel case that has no window in it. Build for airflow and cooling, not really for looks. It does its job well, even though at this point it is beginning to age. A next upgrade will be the time a new case will have to come into play sadly. Fixed incomes do make these kind of upgrades hard...

This brings us to the RGB. While it has the traditional 4pin, it also came with the setup for other kinds, including a USB connector! So those who don't have RGB it appears you can still get your Wraith to light up, though it will likely simply cycle through colors (better than nothing if you want it!) With it hooked into my Auora headers, it looks very pretty matching the board and Geil chips <3

This is most definitely a recommendation I would give to anyone who is a gamer, a streamer, or someone who simply doe a lot with their PC. It is a hard working chip that knows how to do a lot of things at one time.",0.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Low 65W TDP
Affordable

Cons: The 4.4 GHz max boost is a bit of a myth
Potentially better options for single-threaded performance
Overall Review: I built a new system with a Ryzen 3700X a couple weeks ago. I have been using Intel chips in my builds since the release of Sandy Bridge in 2011, but the 3700X caught my eye due to its high multi-thread performance, affordable price, and low TPD of 65W. After using the system for a couple weeks now, I really couldn't be more impressed with this chip's performance. First of all, it performs great right out of the box, no OCing needed. This is a good thing, because there isn't a lot of headroom to OC this chip unless you win the bin lottery and have golden cores that can run at or above max boost. So far, I've found that fast memory with good timings will get you more performance out of this chip than an extra 100-200 MHz per core ever will. So my recommendation is to run it at stock speeds and not even mess with overdrive or auto-OC. In fact, PBO and auto-OC might lower your single core performance. You'll get higher one or two core boosts out of the box, which I prefer for gaming. But the boosting brings me to my only real complaint about this chip: the 4.4 GHz max boost is not something you'll see often at default settings. I often hit 4.3 on multiple cores, but under heavy multi-threaded loads the boost tops out around 4.1 GHz. However, this is a minor complaint because the Ryzen 3000 series has a high IPC and performs well even at the lower boost speeds. Still, seeing ""4.4 GHz"" on the box might make one assume it's a number you'll see often, but it's not, at least not with my Noctua cooler and default voltage and multipliers. But this is literally the only bad thing I can say about this processor. Everything else is amazing: The fact that it can compete with i9s for a fraction of the cost. The low TPD that will save money in energy costs. Paired with a X570 chipset, you'll have PCIe 4.0 support which will future-proof  your system for the higher bandwidth GPUs coming in the next few generations. I would recommend this CPU to any system builder. It's really hard to beat this performance at this price. Sure, there might be faster single-core options out there, but you'll pay a premium for two or three extra frames per second, making this chip the better deal by far.",0.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

-Depending on the chip and your cooling solution, Precision boost 2 will cause at the very least some cores to hit the advertised 4.4GHz boost clock.
-Performance scales well with faster memory - makes OCing memory worthwhile. If you go above 1866 Mhz make sure to lock MemCLK = UClk in bios.
-Includes decent stock cooler
Cons: -Precision boost 2 can be overly aggressive during light workloads. HWInfo reporting core voltage spiking up to 1.49 sitting on the windows desktop.

-If you OC your memory, your board may not be able to deliver enough juice to OC your CPU. I can manage a 4.4GHz all cores lock, but anything higher either fails to POST or crashes windows. (MSI MPG X570 Pro Carbon wifi). Not a big deal if you'd prefer to not OC, or OC memory instead.
Overall Review: Overall very happy with this CPU as it is on par with comparable, more expensive intel chips. For multithreaded apps, performance can be better than intel counterparts.

The usefulness of manually OCing this chip is questionable, as temperature will be the limting factor for non-liquid cooled rigs. PB2 is very good at adjusting the frequency and power delivery to the perfect spot to sit just under your defined TJMax. It also is very good at only boosting frequencies where there is a reason to do so - i.e. the thread is actually being used.

AMD recommends that the chip not exceed 95C, but it will never get close to that outside of torture testing provided you have decent cooling. The included stock cooler is fine.

Undervolting to 1.2 and locking all cores to 3.6GHz yields a fast and very cool CPU for everyday use. Let PB2 do its thing and you've got an awesome gaming/Content Creation CPU. PBO power Limits can be adjusted to make it more likely that PB2 automatically OCs to 4.4.

Would Recommend, but took off one egg for the overly aggressive PB2 algorithm. It can be fixed with a few minor tweaks, such as limiting the CPU's maximum power consumption, but then you are sacrificing performance when you really want it.",0.0,6.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

While the stock cooler is said to work well for non-overclocked systems, most 'gamers' will opt for something a bit more robust. We just do.
The price savings could potentially go toward such a cooler for those who desire the option.
The motherboard manufacturer's BIOS support seems to have been caught off guard.
That is not a fault of the chip...obviously.
It is just something to be aware of when purchasing.
I'm sure over time this will be sorted but as of now, you'll need to do a bit of homework.
Overall Review: This processor replaced my Ryzen 5-2600X...which in of itself, is a great performing CPU.
I can't say enough good things about the added 'up-tick' in performance.
My simulation software loads faster and runs very well.
The time it takes to come out of low power state is drastically reduced as well.

-PCIE Gen4 is a thing, more useful for solid state drives at this point, but AMD has it first.
-Single core performance is now on par with Intel
Cons: Minor detail: Destiny 2 does not run on this at the moment. A BIOS issue with the RDRand instruction that AMD is currently working on a fix for.
Being that this is a game I play, its a bit of an inconvenience.
Overall Review: I used to have an FX 6200... Running at 4.5ghz and heating my place. Honestly it was a terrible CPU, with mediocre performance for a 6 core. I then upgraded to an Intel 4770K, and stayed there for 7 years! Running at a 4.6ghz overclock, my 4770K basically handled everything I could throw at it. But after 7 years, it started falling behind in certain tasks.

Then Ryzen 3 arrived and I decided to switch after studying the reviews.
Needless to say, this 3600X blows my overclocked 4770K out of the water at stock speeds, in both single and multi-core performance.

-Multitasking capability is endless
-Great even at stock settings
-Saves me electricity bills from my old set up on a 4790k
-Amazing hardware
Cons: -Bad software (except Gigabyte )
-Every manufacturer is struggling with having a stable bios except for Gigabyte

If you want an easy and great default out of the box experience, all the forums and Reddit posts suggest you get gigabyte. They have the most stable bios softwares.

As of this moment I'm using a crosshair vii and the current 2501 bios still requires you to manually up your DRAM boot voltages to get your ram running at 3200mhz and above. You also need to disable PBO and more things. In general, you need to look at forums and Reddit and do additional work. Therefore getting a Gigabyte motherboard might be an easier option for you .
Overall Review: Huge upgrade from my 4790k. Although it served me well, the old school way of overclocking took it's toll. Back in the day you overclock your chip and keep it running at that speed the whole time. I guess nowadays the technology for upclocking and downclocking based on work loads have gotten better. I kept the overclock settings on stock so it uses less voltage and lowers the clock speeds when it's not working on heavy loads, and it goes up to 4.5ghz on stock when the load gets heavier. 4.5ghz was the constant clock speed I had my old 4790k overclocked at. However this chip doubles my cores and threads from 4 cores to 8 and from 8 threads to 16. I've definitely felt the increase of multi tasking productivity. From a practical point of view, having a lot of start up apps no longer slow down your computer at start. I have an Android emulator to play my android games while having Adobe premiere running to edit vacation footage and occasionally have a game on alt tab while twitch running with obs. Of course I don't do that everyday, but it's all possible with this chip. My normal workload is just Microsoft office haha, overkill for the 3800x, but now my possibilities seem endless.",0.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Full RGB customization (If set up properly).
Cons: Fully customizable RGB is a tiny bit confusing to get working. Not so much difficult but you need to plug things in very specifically between the cooler and the motherboard to be able to change the colors to whatever you'd like using the Coolermaster software. Even as a tech-savvy person it was ever so slightly confusing figuring it out, once I configured it correctly it made sense though.
Overall Review: I got this to replace my old i5 4th gen Intel processor, with a Gigabyte Aorus X570 Pro Wifi motherboard.

Installation was as expected, nothing's changed too much with that in recent years. Obviously a massive upgrade, happy as can be with the performance by comparison, but who wouldn't be.

The RGB full customization setup is a bit confusing, but some Google searches helped with that. There's a small plug that is covered by a plastic cap initially on the side of the Wraith Prism that you need to run a cable from to a specific plug on your RGB capable motherboard, I don't recall documentation going over it that came with the processor, but Google is your friend. It did come with the cable needed, so that was nice.

Overall Review: So, I am updating this post from the old one, a month or so ago. I hope this helps some people out with the boost clock delima. When I first installed this chip on my ASUS TUF Gaming X570 mobo, I was using the stock cooler. I was getting a flat 4.1 GHz clock speed all the time. Just a few days ago I bought a EVGA CLC 280 cpu cooler and now I am getting between 4.3-4.4 GHz clock while gaming. Looking at the differences on the MSI Afterburner and HWMonitor software I can see that the CPU is now throttling while idle. Which I believe that is what it is designed to do. So, the temperature drop with the new cpu cooler is allowing the cpu to boost much higher.

Why? No reason other than I wanted to try it.... Plenty of power was available with 3600 BTW. Anyway, After BIOS system (using F50) sorted itself out which took a bit (patience grasshopper) the system came right up and booted into Linux as usual and 12 cores were available with 24 threads... Rebooted again to setup my BIOS settings (Turn off Boost to reduce fan cycling, Turn on XMP profile for Memory for max memory speed, Turn on setting for VM use, and turn off numlock on boot were the main settings ). So far, rock solid. Did not notice any 'speed up' improvements of course. That will come later down the road when I will get a x570 motherboard and bump up memory speed to use some of chips potential.

I am using the stock cooler. Removed the thick paste on bottom and replaced with Arctic MX-4 paste. Wish the cooler copper bottom was 'smooth' had to fill cracks with paste. Anyway, temps are runing 35C at idle. Hasn't bumped past 60C yet for the things I've tried. So works for me.

Overall Review: Let me be more clear. This thing is super powerful, and without manually overclocking it I was able to hit past 4.2 GHz. My issue was that I wasn't aware of 2 settings on my mobo--and I don't know if it is card specific or what, but this seems to be a general problem with many AM4 Ryzen CPUs. There are 2 main overclock settings in the BIOS--Performance Override and Core Performance Boost. With stock settings, the CPU was ramping up to 4.2GHz at IDLE. I checked the bios and it took me forever to realize that the Performance Override was separate from the Core Performance boost, and at stock settings the PO was off and the CPB was on. This led to a wacky overclocking that had issues with the temperature sensor on the chip where the chip would drop 10degC over 5 or so seconds and then in a blink of an eye it's up 10-15degC again (an issue I believe with either the temp source or the controlling algorithm they use). So then the fan would be ramping up and down constantly, which made it impossible to focus on anything without getting irritated as it would get so loud I would hear it through my headphones. Anyway, I turned on X-AMP to OC my RAM, and turned off the PO and CPB and now I don't get that issue.

Still wish I knew why I can't get my CPU to idle when my computer is idle. The thing sticks at 3.8GHZ while just staring at a black desktop, no apps running or anything else going on. The chipset drivers don't work with the AMD power profiles that you can choose from--and it seems like windows just does not care at all about whether or not their power profiles are adjustable at all. Whether that's a windows issue, an AMD issue, or I'm just a d*****s, it really shouldn't be this difficult to keep get my computer to operate as any other normal computer would.

Either way, this thing is a beast. Paired with 3600Mhz ram, a 5700 XT, and an x570 mobo, I can plow through 1080p games with 100-200 fps.",0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Compiled Firefox in 13:48 which is simply amazing. On other vendors CPUs, I have to disable SMT (Hyer-Threading) for that extra 30% boost in compile times. On this CPU, wow, keeping SMT on is actually faster, which means I when I pull up System Monitor, I am awed to see 16 CPUs. The extra PCI channels offer direct access of the M2 drive to the CPU and I am writing to disk at 2.1 GB/s which is 3 times faster than anything I could achieve my SSD.

The stock cooler appears to have much higher quality than the competitor's stock cooler. I'm not a fan a flashy RGB, but the fan color changes nicely so I'm leaving it on.
Very good value, probably won't need to upgrade in 3-4 years without any significant performance suffering
Cons: The idle temperature fluctuates between 35 to 50, average around 40-45. According to what I read, it's a little high but no harm.
Overall Review: Yes, I would definitely recommend this to PC builders. I think this model is a very good sweet spot. It's not the fastest desktop CPU out there, but the faster models cost significantly more without giving as much speed bumps. No it doesn't have much overclock headroom even though it can technically. But, for value buyers, I don't believe overclocking is worth the investment even if you just look at the material cost and benefits (not to mention to time spent). To overclock, you have to use a after-market nice cooler, a better motherboard. Those cost add up to half of this CPU cost. Does that overclocking extend the lifetime by half WITHOUT experiencing performance compromises? Probably not. So then why not save the overclock cost and just buy a new CPU?

Boosting the CPU's speed is easy. All you have to do is change the power settings in windows. (remember to download the chipset drivers as well).
Cons: I wouldn't say this is a 'con' but something to note. The CPU does run a little warm idling using the balanced/high-performance power setting (which allows speeds up to 4.17 GHz). I have a deep cooler 240mm AIO and just using chrome/Youtube, the temps are between 30-50 C. (50 C. usually being the peak and jumps up to that temperature but doesn't stay there).
Overall Review: Overall, a great CPU. This is my first AMD CPU and I have no real complaints.

In regards to the idle temps, I have been using the 'power saver' mode when I am browsing the web/Youtube/Twitch which basically keeps the temperature between 28-30 C, though the CPU speed is locked in around 2.2 GHz. But at least for me, I don't need that much CPU power when I am using chrome/youtube, because I have 32 GB of ram and an SSD, so things still run smooth and quick.
When I want to do some gaming, all I do I switch back to the 'high performace' mode and I get fast clock speeds. And in-terms of temperatures for gaming, the CPU does really well. When I play Overwatch, the temps are between 35-50, very similar to the idle temps when you have the 'high-performance' mode on.",0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

I remember when my 4790K at 4.8Ghz was running at like 80% usage on one core in that application this speaks highly of the IPC of Zen 2.

Power efficiency is at another level this CPU is using like 20 watts doing normal tasks i can’t even understand how that’s possible.

Stock cooler is also a beast however i’m running this on a H150i.

I do play games and most of the games I play only use a few cores and i can tell you that these games perform very well but i also have 3600mhz ram running at 14 timings.

For others make sure you are running on the latest bios and the latest chipset drivers from Amd directly! Also higher voltage is fine as long as you keep temps in check this has been confirmed by Amd to be normal behavior on Ryzen 3000 series.
Cons: Amd changed the SMU behavior on AGESA 1.0.0.3 and newer and now Ryzen 3000 doesn’t boost properly and it’s rumored that Amd had to change this for reliability issues so it might never be fixed.
Overall Review: I have been buying Ryzen since first gen mainly because I enjoy testing the product out and comparing IPC figures. Zen 2 clearly has IPC on par with Intel if not better the issue is latency between cores and the memory controller which is still crazy high compared to Intel(intel 45ns vs 68ns with Amd). Which affects gaming performance. Even then Amd is very close to Intel’s gaming performance and you will only notice on an RTX 2080 or above and even then we are talking 10FPS-30FPS and you will still be getting 120+ FPS.

For application performance their is no competition this is the better deal then a 9700K its faster and almost as fast as a 5 ghz 9900K go look at the benchmarks read reviews don’t just watch youtube videos.

Note to all please use Ryzen calculator to get more performance your gains in games will be pretty massive with faster memory and more importantly tuned memory using this program.

Owned 1700>2700X>3700X

In just 2.5 years according to CPU-Z the single threaded score is 400 on a 1800X and my 3700X gets 523 points. In R15 the 1800X gets 160 in the single core score my chip gets 205 now let's compare that performance.

523/400= 30.75%
205/160= 28.1%
So basically in just 2.5 years Amd improved single core performance by 30% when is the last time Intel has done that in 3 years or less? Let's also remember that they increased cores by 200% as 16 cores will be here in September.

Overall Review: My first chip was bad, but AMD quickly replaced it. The original chip ran but was ready extremely hot under full load.

This is both my workstation and my gaming rig. I am a software developer and this chip easily handles multiple projects compiling simultaneously. In game it runs fantastically.

- less expensive than Intel so you can put that money elsewhere in your build
- really unleashes nearly the top performance of Samsung NMVe
Cons: - unsure about any gains over 3700x
Overall Review: If you bought a 3000 series processor you got yourself a high performance processor and it's boosting to give you that performance when called upon. I had no problems out of the box with ASRock X470 Master SLI/AC w/ BIOS/UEFI version P3.30 (AGESA 1.0.0.1)

Remember before installing this processor to update the following...
1) BIOS/UEFI with AGESA Combo-AM4 1.0.0.1 (minimum)
2) Chipset drivers from AMD
3) Windows 10 to version 19.03
4) Ryzen Master

Stock cooler should be fine but if you already have an AIO even better.

For 430 ish USD yo get 12 cores and 24 threads, that's something intel can't offer you and I know it's not the same clockspeed, Ryzen is slower, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Unless you are a competitive player that needs the higher FPS count as possible then AMD got your back.
This cpu is capable of doing everything, playing games and productivity where the multicore shines.

Overall Review: I bought this chip because I game but I also record music and wanted something to handle a 32-track session with multiple real-time plugins running as easily as it handles Doom Eternal.
Did my research and found strictly gaming PCs should go with team blue or the 3600 or 3400x Ryzen models and the 3800x is just a slightly higher binned version of this same chip.
It came down to the 3700x or 3900x for me and I chose to save the extra money for 3600 speed RAM.
This easily outperforms the 1700 it’s replacing in every aspect of computing. I can actually tell in any program I use. They open faster, load sooner and run smoother across the board.
The first proc I got had bent pins, first time in 16 years of building my own computers and Newegg took care of it with zero hassle. Very pleased with how they treated me as a long time customer. They will certainly be getting more of my business in the future.

For what I do (GPU rendering) The core count doesn't matter too much beyond 4-8. So, I went with 8 and less power/heat. I didn't even need to buy an expensive cooler this time around. Unlike my 1700X which required a Noctua with push-pull to stay under 70. Even with these summer temps my CPU never exceeds 65C and that is while rendering my work. idles at about 28c and boosts easily to 4.6.

Cons: The fact that AMD was not able to hit 5GHZ this gen is depressing. But, there is always the next-gen to look forward too.

I recommend to NOT use PBO or manually overclock this. The Ryzen's aren't designed for that and perform much better stock for gaming. This runs great with the Wraith Spire stock cooler, no need to run an AIO cooler but you can. Pair this with the Gigabyte RX 5600 XT 6GB WindForce OC (update the card BIOS when you get it, 2 fan model is fine) and enjoy 124 average FPS on Ultra in Far Cry 5 @ 1080p! On CPU-Z I get 530 single core and 4214 multi-core, edging out most CPU's except the extreme series Intel's and the ThreadRipper AMD's. Just under the 3900X.
Cons: Don't bother with the X570 boards, they won't, this won't hit the 3600mhz-3733mhz ""sweet spot"" with memory. The Infinity Fabric or the chipset itself has a limitation where I found 3466mhz RAM will be the max for now.
Overall Review: I would recommend this CPU for any gamer or business class PC. It runs like the wind, keeps up with or blows Intel away in most everything that matters. Benchmarks with 5ghz might be impressive but not practical for everyday use or gaming. I had an i7 8700K build with an Nvidia 1080, this rivals that in many ways. Surpasses it in multi-threaded apps and single core, even graphics are hard to beat with this combo. Then the power consumption or lack there of is nice. Less heat, more game.
Don't waste money on 3733mhz-3600mhz RAM at this time. The best is either low latency 3200mhz or 3466mhz in a 16GB kit for gaming. More than 16GB of RAM will cause your RAM speed to be less and latency go up. It sends you more toward the ""business end"" of PC's then. You can skip the X570/470 boards unless you plan on running the expensive, few, Gen 4.0 PCIE SSD's. A Gen 3.0 works fine or a regular SSD.
That's the best part. Skipping my errors and saving money! For around $600 you can get all you need to put something together. X or no X the Ryzen 5 3600 is a great, cheap CPU!",0.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

I’m using it for gaming and music production with my old gtx 1060, 16gb gskill z trident 3600 ram on a gigabyte x570 aorus elite. Decent for 1080p gaming and much better than my old i7-4790k for music production multitasking.
Cons: For gaming in particular, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn’t much of a performance leap from my 6 year old i7-4790k. Though over locking actually has potential again. Memory controller still has comparably high latency which is probably the cause of the gaming meh factor for me.
Overall Review: First AMD processor in like 12 years. Competition is a great thing for consumers! I’m so happy to be happy about my purchase. I know AMD has been back for a while but they weren’t back for me until me and my buddies all gave the thumbs up after my builds...and at the price we paid? (Smiles)",0.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: Building my new PC, I really wanted the 3900X. But with the next gen around the corner and how quickly building a PC can get expensive, I decided to save some money and go with the 3600X as a starter. I figured it was worth a try as everyone else praises it and I never hear any regrets from others. I see why now!

Beyond having to make sure my board's BIOS was up to date, it was simply a matter of removing the old, and popping in the new CPU.

Tons of threads, more than I can use in ordinary tasks. Basically means that every demanding task gets 2+ dedicated cores. So you can be gaming, watching videos and surfing the web at the same time and still have a ton of capacity left over to compile or whatever.

Overall Review: I would recommend this product to those who, at this price point, are looking for a CPU that can run games smoothly, and is doing a good amount of productivity work loads.

Cons: I don't get 4.2ghz max boost. I saw 3.95ghz max out of the box. I replaced the stock cooler with a Noctua NH15 and temps run about 10C cooler but it didn't increase the boost at all. I'm nowhere near the 95C default thermal throttle. Turned on the performance overclocking from AMD, I am now up to 4.117ghz max boost and 73C max temp. Again, still well below the 95C threshold yet it still refuses to hit 4.2ghz boost. More aggressive overclocking results in instability. Spent a few hours with the DRAM calculator but was unable to tighten anything beyond the XMP profile. That said, I am outperforming baseline benchmarks from passmark for the same CPU -- so I'm guessing no one is getting 4.2ghz max boost (yay?)
Overall Review: If a person can't get 4.2ghz max boost *out of the box with the stock cooler and without overclocking* (at a reasonable ambient temp), then it shouldn't be advertised as 4.2ghz max boost. I haven't hit it even with overclocking. *update* I did hit 4.2ghz stable overclock, no boost.",0.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

-Big thumbs up for NewEggs RMA process. Its easy and it just work.
Cons: This is actually the second one, due to the first one boot looping on me. Clearing CMOS, resetting/reseating everything did not work.

Be prepared for temperatures you will not be used too. I am idling at 28C to 32C. Gaming pops it up to 50C to 60C and Prime95 hit 93C (95C is max). Prime95 was the full CPU stress test. I am using a Zalman 9500 air cooler and Artic MX-4 thermal paste.

Did the on/off cycle and I got into the bios. Easy days. I restarted and booted into windows. Ran some test and checks. Booted back into the bios and updated to 6.00. Rebooted, more checks, booted back into the bios and set the ram to XMP profile 1, boosting me to 3200. Ran Prime95 for a couple of hours to check thermals and profit. :)

Cons: Somewhat rushed, issues with some BIOS's
Cooler is meh, probably won't hit full boost speeds with it
Low base clock, an area Intel still dominates
Good value, but not as good as the 3600.
Overall Review: This thing is a beast. I put it against my overclocked Ryzen 1700 in multi-threaded applications and wasn't disappointed in the slightest. It's neck in neck with a processor that has 4 extra threads, higher power consumption, and a higher base clock (OC@4ghz on the 1700). Wow! In single threaded applications the 3600x shreds my 1700 and is noticeably faster in games. Keep in mind that the 1700 was $300 at launch only 2 years ago. AMD has made tremendous strides in performance and value.

Unfortunately it's not all peaches and cream. Some older motherboards (ASRock Fata1ity B450 K4 for me) weren't ready for this launch, thus creating some bugs in the BIOS. The most common being issues with voltages, creating higher temperatures. This CPU sips power and shouldn't run hot, but if your motherboard has this bug your temps will be affected by as much as 20c. Also, the 3600x is not worth the extra cost over the 3600. Period. Don't waste your money, there's no reason to buy the 3600x over the 3600 (unless the 3600 is sold out). If you know how to overclock, you could achieve higher performance on the 3600.

Outside of comparing it to products in its own line-up, this CPU is a monster, and I don't regret the purchase.
Ram speed is important when considering your DDR4 kit. Sweet spot is apparently 3600 MHz with low latency.
For a small performance increase in multi-thread I did an all core manual overclock to 4.3 GHz @ 1.32V stable. It's a little disappointing the overclock doesn't reach it's stated boost clock, but i suppose that's more an issue with my own expectations and drinking the hype flavored kool-aid.

Cons: As far as I can tell there are no cons here aside from every now and again applications like CCleaner locking up and possibly using more memory than it should or otherwise slowing the computer down...

Overall Review: Overall, if you want a good product that I've only used for a few weeks but doesn't seem to have any bugs or issues that I have found yet, and is good for both games, and productivity works such as video editing and things of that nature that require multiple CPU cores, this is the product to get because it is a good price to performance ratio as far as I'm concerned... I could have got by with eight cores and 16 threads of something a little smaller, around a 3700X or 3600X, I do a lot of differing things with my computer and wanted to make sure that whether I'm gaming or creating a custom windows ISO or video editing or 3D CAD work or if I want to get into 3D printing I wanted to have the best performance that I could get for a low enough price and I could not justify getting a 3950X on account of it being $400 more...",0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

- power useage outside of high load is comparable to that of 3600, meaning it works well for builds that are trying to maintain a power budget.

- performs exceptional well with running virtual machines.
Cons: - on auto mode for multiplier it loves to ramp up to max and stay there on b550 boards, not an issue on full size ATX, but my Mini Itx, I had to lock it in at 42/43 to get the heat / sound profile I wanted.

- Is expensive for a 3600. Is a high quality 3600, but unless you are building either a OC beast or another specialized machine, you are probably overpaying.
Overall Review: First off, love this chip. For me, it was what I wanted in that its a high quality chip that will run for 5 to 6 years at its current settings without issue. Signs are that it will run from now till then without issue, which is great for me.

Odds are however you are not building your machine to do what mine does, unless you do Geospatial number crunching and are building a small portable machine to run multiple processor intensive vms to connect to rare and out of date hardware and databases. And, well, gaming on the side because I need the same hardware in there anyway.

OCing and reliability is what you are paying for, and in both cases you are paying a premium for a gain of maybe 5 to 6%

- I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 2700 (not the x unfortunately -_-) and noticed a significant increase in performance. I mainly use my PC for video editing and playing games and I love this CPU. I don't really play any super intense video games (FFXIV, No man's sky, Project Car 2 VR, CIV 5) but I did notice a nice improvement in performance, especially in Civilization 5.
- I was cooling my 2700 with a garbage Rosewill PB240 CPU Liquid Cooler 280mm radiator with two 120mm corsair fans instead of the stock ones, so I deiced to use that on the 3900x and use the stock cooler on the 2700. This may have been a mistake, because I have never been able to OC my 2700 so easily with the previously mentioned water cooler from Rosewill. I just put the 2700 at 3.9Ghz and even at a full load for an hour it never went above 56 C (of course I keep my house at 71 F and it doesn't have to share a case with a RTX 2080 anymore). Of course I could have just won the silicon lottery, that 2700 is an OC beast that I've gotten stable at 4.35Ghz before using a ventilation duct from an air conditioner strait into the case with idle to top temp being 12 C to 64 C.
What I'm getting at is don't be like me, and give the stock cooler a chance, because with that Rosewill I idle around 58 C and hit 80 C on a full all core load. Also the mounting plate is probably not on it very well (I should write a review for how bad that water cooler is).",0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: Coming from a Intel i7-3770 to this was a huge upgrade the difference was like night and day WOW
Everything runs so much faster and smoother with this Ryzen 5 vs my older i7 don't get me wrong that older computer is still going strong it just can't touch this bad boy.
This is my first new build since 2013 and my mind was blown once I got it running

AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT 12-Core 3.8 GHz Socket AM4 105W 100-100000277WOF Desktop Processor,2163.0,5,479.0,Marco R.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,6/30/20 14:31,5.0,"Pros: - Great value for the speed
- Approximately 25% faster than the Ryzen 5 1600 it is replacing.
- AMD rocks in terms of compatibility, since I can use this with the B350M board/DDR4 2800 that I bought several years ago with the Ryzen 5 1600.
- Core boost logic is vastly improved relative to the Ryzen 1 series, since more than one core can boost now.
- PCIe 4.0, which will mesh well with my new GPU if I ever decide that it makes sense to upgrade my motherboard.
- Better AVX2 performance, but this isn't really noticeable in day-to-day use unless you have optimized programs.
Cons: - I don't think the stock cooler is adequate, given the pretty minimal thermal headroom (see below). However, given the low price of the product, I can't imagine that AMD is charging us much more for the free cooler.
- This thing runs HOT. My Ryzen 5 1600 rarely exceeded 55c using an Arctic Cooling Freezer 12 (rated at 150W). The same cooler, same brand of thermal paste on the 3600 idles around 50c. The slightest actions (opening a browser tab) will spike this by 10-15c, while running demanding programs (Rosetta@Home) puts the CPU in the 80-85c realm. I thought that maybe I applied the thermal paste poorly, so I cleaned it off and reapplied. After giving it another thermal break-in period, it is about the same as before, still peaking around 80c. From what I can read online, this is due to the new core boost logic (PBO) which will boost cores up as long as the CPU has enough cooling/voltage headroom. I have also read that the 3600 is more 'conservative' with its temperature reporting, reporting something closer to the maximum of all sensors on the chip rather than the mean. I haven't noticed stability problems of any kind, but those temperature spikes took a while to get used to.
Overall Review: I would definitely recommend this product, especially for people upgrading from 1-series or low 2-series processors. It is a noticeable improvement for a very reasonable price, and can be used with basically all of the original Ryzen-compatible motherboards.",0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Performs slightly worse than an Intel of the exact class for 1/5 of the price. You can over clock it for more power if that's your thing. Me personally I don't want to overclock anything I want it it ready to go but it's nice that it's a feature and can pump more power out of it.

Won't win any extreme contests but is fantastic bang for the buck.
Comes with stock cooler if you need basic cooling
Cons: Runs warm with stock cooler. The cooler is big and beefy with a nice sized fan, but it was consistently running mid 50's to mid 60's at ""idle"" in my ATX system which has four 140mm case fans blowing through.
Overall Review: This chip is really versatile. Works good with programs like Photoshop and Lightroom, works good for gaming. I haven't tried video editing yet but I'm confident it will do just fine. I was surprised how warm this got just at idle and under load being rated a 65 watt chipset. My old rig would generally stay in the 40-50C range and only slightly creep higher than that under load where this one wanted to idle at about 50C. I put a Noctua cooler on it and that helped alot, dropped about 8-10C right off the bat. I don't know if it's sub-par thermal paste that's pre-stamped on the stock heatsink or what, but it really didn't do the job. I wish there was a slightly cheaper version that didn't include the stock cooler if you know you're not going to use it.",0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Cons: Runs pretty warm. The stock cooler is adequate at best.

Definitely happy I went with the R5 3600. It's a stellar processor for a great price. I game and render 3D models on this rig, so it made sense to me to grab the higher thread count part.

The only real downside here is the stock cooler. To it's credit, it does its job, and keeps the chip from throttling, but just barely. If you want to overclock at ALL, I would recommend getting an aftermarket cooler. My processor idles at 45-60°C, with a lot of surging at idle, which with the noise of the Wraith Stealth, can be a little annoying in a totally silent office, but no big deal most of the time. It was pretty easy to just set a fan profile that was smoother in this area and the noise settled in.

Would definitely recommend an aftermarket cooler for any overclocking of course.

RMA process was extremely slow
Overall Review: Update:
After replacing both the motherboard and CPU I have a fully working PC and so far it's been great. I upgraded from an i7 2600k so this is the a pretty substantial bump in processing power. I'm giving it 4 stars due to the RMA process. It took 2 weeks to have the broken version sent, received by Newegg, and have a replacement in hand.

Original Review:
When I turned on my build the system would just boot loop constantly. I was able to get it post a total of 3 times and during one of those the system just shut off randomly. At first I thought it was the mobo (gigabyte Aorus x570 itx) so I had it replaced and had the same boot loop behavior. I swapped out the mobo, ram, PSU, SSD, and GPU while troubleshooting.

I typically only play games after they've been out for a few years, so I know that I can max out any AAA game from 2015 (I imagine it'd do similarly well with newer games). I'm getting 60-90 fps in Witcher 3 and R6 Siege, but I'm definitely GPU bound right now, so this CPU could probably do more. I can also run SolidWorks well. I'm using AMD's StoreMI, which was a little finicky to setup, but works well now that it's done (see overall review for more details).
Cons: The included cooler came with a little debris in the thermal compound. However, that didn't really affect me, since I'm using a Hyper 212 BE. With that cooler, I'm getting a max of 74C with Game Boost on. I can't say if the included cooler could handle that.
Overall Review: I'd recommend getting an after-market cooler if you want to use Game Boost. If you're using StoreMI, make sure both drives are empty.

When Zen first came out, this was a great come back for AMD, but they kept refining their techology and this truly shows with Zen 2.
-Small TDP.
-Lots of value compared to Intel CPUs.
Cons: -The only issue I have is not with the CPU itself, but with the Wraith Prism it comes bundled with. While the cooler has great aesthetic and good temps, the fan tends to reacts too fast when small temperature changes occurs. (this was confirmed on a few reviewing sites) What this does is that when you're idle, the fan will often quickly rev up from 1500 to around 2000 RPM, and then quickly goes down to 1500 RPM. While I'm totally fine with the sound of the fan itself, the lack of RPM consistency makes the rev up/rev down behavior a bit annoying. And I'm a bit unlucky here: arguably I could set up a better fan curve in the BIOS of the motherboard, but there is a bug in the BIOS preventing me from saving new fan curves :S (For your information: motherboard with said glitch is MSI MPG X570 GAMING PLUS)
Overall Review: I previously had a Core I5 6500 CPU which was great for the time it was used, but am I glad for this Ryzen upgrade! Highly recommended! Just be aware of the aggressive fan behavior with the Wraith Prism though.",0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I purchased this as an upgrade from an i7-6700K. I do most of my gaming using a Vive and Vive wireless adapter and can say this CPU really helps out a lot. The Wireless adapter requires a solid CPU and the 6700k was barely cutting it. With the 3800x, I no longer have any compression artifacts that I was having before.

I noticed a slight difference in ""snappyness"" or how fast things started with this compared to my 2700x.

I had instant buyers remorse. If you are considering this, please look at the percent difference from your current processor. All that said, I'm still using it so it can't be too bad!

- Fantastic price-to-performance ratio.
- Did not need to change my Motherboard, so I saved a nice chunk of cash on that one (which allowed me to get this model instead of the Ryzen 5 3600 which I would have gotten otherwise).
- Staying with my ASUS B350 Plus did not give me any problems. All that was required beforehand was to update the BIOS to the latest version (version 5220 as of this typing).
- After installing and starting up the computer for the first time everything worked flawlessly, all detected properly and at rated speeds in the BIOS. From that point on it's AMD funland time.
Cons: - CPUs like this don't grow in trees? I don't know, really. There's genuinely no Cons I can think of.
Overall Review: I upgraded from my previous Ryzen 5 (1st Gen) 1600 to this monster. I already see differences just in regular desktop usage. My everyday programs just respond faster, it's ""snappier"" overall; and many of my programs open / installed faster.

For gaming it significantly boosted the performance in the majority of my games, especially for the minimum FPS average. An example: minimum FPS on my previous setup in Borderlands 3 in the first base looking just outside toward the Catch A Ride station I would get around 48 to 50 FPS at maxed out settings, at 1080p resolution that is. Now looking at the same exact spot I get 66 to 68 (it varies a bit). This sort of boost to minimum frame rate is present in most of my games.

Also, I haven't overclocked it yet but I don't see a need to do so. It's already running at 3.6Ghz pretty much all the time and the slightest activity in the desktop catapults this beast into the 4.0 to 4.1Ghz range in no time with its automatic boost technology.

Inexpensive compared to the equivalent performing CPU from Team Blue

Includes fairly nice stock cooler with copper heatpipes and snazzy RGB LEDs that's controllable by downloadable software on AMD's site. The cooler plugs into a standard USB 2.0 header on your motherboard.

Only 65 watts!

Has pretty much doubled my framerate in Overwatch compared to the Ryzen 3 2200G.

Works in every existing AM4 motherboard, as long as BIOS updates are available from the manufacturer.
Cons: Stock cooler had a tendency to loudly spin up and down every few seconds until I went into my UEFI settings and set a custom fan curve; this may be more of a con for my motherboard and not this CPU - but my previous CPU (Ryzen 3 2300G) in this motherboard didn't do this.

Goes out of stock often. :(

AMD still uses pins on the CPUs instead of LGA sockets so I'm always extra careful (and slightly worried) about bending the pins during installation.

It's so powerful. I never see it maxing out with the most demanding tasks I have for it, and it's staying relatively cool.

I can see where the 3600 (no X) would be a much better value for overclockers, but I look at it like this: The 3600X is still very affordable, and with a higher stock base speed, that's enough for it to perform virtually as well as a fully-overclocked all-core 3600 but with better thermals. I'm not much of an overclocker, so I think this was the chip for me.

The stock cooler actually works great and is easy to install.
Cons: Not really a con, but I'm hearing that it really pays to make sure you're using a motherboard with good VRMs for Ryzen 3rd gen. Without a nice VRM setup backing you up, it may prolong the life of the chip to undervolt it slightly to make sure the voltage is in spec, so you don't have electron migration issues later. Also, do yourself a favor and get DDR4 3200 RAM for it, or higher if you overclock.
Overall Review: AMD is back, baby!

I chose this thing for its single-core performance value, but it gives me 6 cores and 12 threads anyways, a 4.4 GHz boost, and it just shreds through gigs of data and roars for more. Primary use for this machine is a sim which is very CPU intensive, and my RTX 2070 Super (which outperforms a 1080 Ti) is the bottleneck in the sim, not my processor!

I DO think AMD and the Mobo Mfgs should test what I've found and if I'm right they should put notices in the manuals and on their websites letting people know they need to feed the beast and plug in that 4 pin CPU power connector.
Overall Review: Not so fast......started noticing heat issues and high voltages.

Changed power plans, (too many times to count).

Used ONLY Ryzen Master to measure temps and voltages.

Used Only CPU-Z to measure voltages.

Flashed BIOS from f3 to f4f, didn't help.

Couple days later....Boom, got a blue screen.

Found that my board has put me back on f3 bios!!!!!!!!

Found corrupted Windows files. Ran SFC /scannow several times, ran dism restorehealth

Tried every fix I could think of and every fix I could find on the web. Nothing fixed the issues and problems

Did a fresh install of Windows and afterward had 2 blue screens inside an hour and each time mobo had switched me, first from bios f4f to f3 and the second time from f3 back to f4f. I'm assuming this is the boards dual bios switching me from main to backup bios and then back to main.

All my browsers started crashing when playing a video on Youtube and elswhere.

Finally, it's 2 o'clock in the morning after days of battle, I'm exhausted and decide to throw in the towel. I'm going to return what I can and sell what I can't and go back to my old system.

Then, I'm looking at the computer, laying on it's side with the cover off and.....WAIT! I see the 4 pin CPU power connector that I've never once in my life used, (I don't overclock so don't need the extra power),zip tied back to the main CPU power cable out of the way.

I clipped off the zip tie......plugged in the 4 pin next to the 8 pin and, boys and girls, the issues have disappeared.

No more blue screens, no more switching of bios, core voltage is much more stable, temps are more stable and lower.

The CPU was power starved.

Moral of the story, (I think), is to PLUG IN THAT 4 PIN CPU POWER CONNECTOR!

No longer thinking of returning or selling anything except the old Intel setup as I'm now very happy with this one!

About 3 years ago I spent approx $250 on an i5 6600K. At the time there was no need for more then 4 Cores 4 Threads unless you were into heavy workloads, which I was not. And to this day its still a decent little gaming CPU. I had it OC's to 4.5Ghz all cores for the entire 3 plus years with zero issues. Now that game developers are really starting to take advantage of more CPU Cores it was time to future proof myself and upgrade. I held off the temptation to buy a 2700X with all the great discounts leading up to the 3000 launch and got myself a 3700X and ASUS Strix X570-E Motherboard. Aside from the expected hickups of early BIOS and a few minor annoyances, it was the right choice. I am seeing a 15-20% FPS improvement across the board in most AAA games. This with Percussion Boost 2 enabled and dropping the CPU voltage to 1.33v. If you leave the 3700X at stock voltage it will run really hot even at idle. The only drawback to lowering the voltage with PB2 enabled instead of a manual OC is that you will max out around 4.25Ghz. Which really equates to more speed then the actual raw frequency because of the 15% IPC gain. Meaning my 3700X at only 4.25Ghz easily beats my i5 6600K at 4.5Ghz in games by a noticeable margin.
Cons: That brings me to my only real complaint about Ryzen 3000 series. I enjoy overclocking manually. But there is really no point anymore. AMD's auto overclocking (provided you manually drop the CPU voltage) does it all for you and does it will. I get that most people probably welcome this change. But to me it takes the fun out of it. A message to AMD - Your stock CPU voltage settings are WAY TO HIGH! Its turns even my high end custom waterloop into a space heater. The sweet spot for my chip is 1.33v and that is actually a little higher then widely reported sweet spot of 1.325v.
Overall Review: My advice is simple. If you are on a limited budget and primarily game. Get a R5 3600 or 3600X. If you have a little more to spend do yourself a favor and get a R7 3700X. It won't be long until game developers really start taking full advantage of even 8 core 16 thread CPUs. I feel that even CPUs like the value king R5 3600 is a placeholder purchase. Get as many cores and threads as you can afford for a more future proof rig.",0.0,63.0,71.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

This was a scary change for me; AMD hadn't made a competitive chip for years, and my last dance with AMD had been with a Phenom 2.
But a leap I made, and one that I do not regret.

1700x and I, spent hours in the garage tweaking and benching, and yet even more hours playing and rendering.
We had an amazing time overall, but something was missing.
A need that Intel fulfilled but AMD unfortunately couldn't.
My Intel Fanboy friends would say, ""Enjoy low FPS,"" with a smile on their faces.

Then the announcement came, ""ZEN 2!""
Rejoice AMD fanboys alike, for our savior is here!
That looming fear nagged on though.
Could it really be on par with Intel in GAMING!?

Overall Review: DISCLAIMER: I am NOT for team Intel OR AMD. I just want the best product that will give me the best performance for my intended uses. All the reviews I see here that are either critical of the chip or leave reviews less 5 stars are instantly labeled as unhelpful. Here is my experience…

Installation and setup of the 3700X onto an x570 motherboard was very easy and simple. I used a relatively popular motherboard, which was the ASUS AM4 TUF Gaming X570-Plus. Installation of drivers and setting up RAM speeds went smoothly. So far I’ve seen fantastic performance increases from my 6 year old i5 4670k.

From my current experience the 3700X chip is a fantastic processor that offers great performance and value when compared to Intel's current lineup. From a gaming perspective the 9700k still offers slightly better performance. From benchmarks you can find from tech reviewers, benchmarks show the i7 9700k still holds a slight lead (5 to 10 percent) over the 3700X. But, when you consider that the 3700X is $285 (Newegg promotion at the time) and that the 9700k retails at $379, I'd say that the performance difference makes sense. Also the fact that it comes with a decent heatsink CPU coolers is a nice touch.

The multi-threaded performance is where this chip shows its true prowess. In high productivity workloads the 3700X can prove its worth as there are benchmarks that prove that it can +30 percent performance over the 9700k. I plan to do some productivity work as well as gaming, so this chip is perfect for me. But this does not mean it does not have its flaws.
AMD specifies this chip to be able to reach a max boost speed of 4.4 GHz. IT DOES NOT. If you do a simple search online you can see that tons of people make this claim. Tips and suggestions online suggest you update your motherboard BIOs and that should fix the issue.

The latest motherboard BIOs drivers on March 2020, latest AMD chipset drivers, latest update of Windows 10 does NOT fix the issue. You would think that a motherboard that is relatively popular would have fixed this issue by now. Running a single or multicore test on Cinebench, using HWinfo64 shows that my chip can NOT reach 4.4 GHz. The closest I’ve gotten is 4.3 GHz. This is also with Windows power plan set to the AMD Performance mode. This is not a major issue to me, as it a .1 GHz difference. I just wish they didn’t misadvertise these unreachable speeds.

There are also driver (or performance) issues in which if you sit in idle with no high CPU usage apps in the background, the CPU at times may inadvertently jump to 4.2 GHz for no reason. You need to double check to see if your AMD Balanced Plan actually clocks down back to 3.5 GHz. Make sure you install the latest AMD Chipset drivers. For me the balance plan seems to work 60 percent of the time.

My last complaint is the chip’s TDP. In case you didn’t know the thermal design point or TDP of a chip is the maximum amount of heat generated. This chip is specified at 65W TDP, but don’t let this fool you. This chip runs HOT. Based on my experiences this specification is most likely rated for the base clock levels only. Siting at idle with a Scythe Fuma 2 dual tower air cooler, this thing sits at 43-55 C. I am glad I pick up a third party cooler, because I can’t imagine this chip’s temperature without it. I’d highly highly recommend a third party cooler. My 4670k has a TDP of 84W, which I paired with a single tower air cooler (Cooler Master Evo 212), and that thing never got that hot at idle. At the peaks it got to 60 C under load.

Aside from the few problems I’ve talked about above, this is still a fantastic chip that can handle modern games with no issues. On top of that you can do some moderate productivity work. When I purchased this at $285 during the time of the review, I still believe it is tremendous value for a processor that has similar gaming performance of a 9700k, but also added cores for games/projects that require multicore support. Another thing that pushed me to this chip was that the PS5 and new Xbox series is expected to come with the same Zen2 architecture utilizing 8 cores. So I expect that would beneficial for games on the Zen2 platform as we’d expect developers to optimize to Zen2. I have full confidence this processor will last me the next 6 years.

Much better value than the 9700K, its main competitor

Cons: Not very good at overclocking, but does it need to be?
Overall Review: This CPU is simply amazing, this is my fourth PC I have built and all three of my previous ones I went with Intel.
Intel isn't bad, but AMD is blowing them out of the water right now.

8 cores and 16 threads compared to 8 cores and 8 threads on a more expensive CPU (9700K)? The 3700X might not be as competent in gaming, but if you do any multitasking at all, such as Streaming and Gaming for example, or if you do any sort of creative work on your PC like editing videos (like me) or 3D rendering, this is the CPU to buy.

Intel can't even compete. Plus, as the years go on, games will inevitably use more cores and threads, making this CPU a great choice for those of you who think in the long term.
If you're strictly gaming and aren't much of the creative type, then I would recommend the 3600 instead of this, or getting the 9700K instead if your budget allows.",0.0,14.0,16.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Scores over 2,000cb in Cinebench R15 with stock cooler and without doing any manual overclocking.
RGB on the stock cooler is bright and fluid. It looks very nice!
Cons: I don't really like the amount of pressure the heatsink requires to install. I've never liked this mounting method, but I guess that's just personal preference.

This guy runs pretty hot, at least with the stock cooler. I've seen temperatures up to 80-85c under full load, and this is with 4 additional case fans in a well ventilated case. It looks like the default voltages are incredibly high with spikes upwards of 1.5v. AMD says this is fine, and I trust them, but it still runs hotter than I'd like.

- Holds up well with 1080p gaming w/frames > 60 (matters for 144 refresh monitors)
- Much more future proof than intel atm.
- 65 TDP!!! That means you can use a PASSIVE heatsink like HE02 - yeah I'm one of them. Coupled with a graphics card that has fanless mode means I can have a perfectly silent machine before gaming. Major kudos and haven't been able to do that in a long time.
- Comes with RGB stock cooler that doesn't suck like intel's cereal box worthy one.
Cons: - Pre-launch hype made us think we were getting closer to 5.0 ghz which intel still has the title for (gaming for 1st/single processor heavy games still prefer intel with ~10-20% gap)
- Virtually no overclock. (though CPU overclocking is mostly dumb when you do the math long term)
- Still has some kinks to work out including nvidia's odd handling of AMD's SMT. (look it up)
Overall Review: Started as an AMD fanboy back in 2000's. Went to Intel about a decade or so ago when both parties fell asleep but Intel kept winning the gaming/single core front. Ryzen 1 or 2 series didn't impress me at all either especially for anyone who games.

Waited 5+ generations to upgrade and went into this upgrade expecting a lot as one should. Seriously I don't understand why most people upgraded w/step upgrades. Should have donated that money or something to a charity.

Been wanting AMD to come back and put some competitive pressure in this monopoloy and they did! Happy to say AMD finally made the case for me to not only switch to AMD but upgrade as my intel 4790k which was king for so long. Still is perfectly fine for any title leveraging < 4c/8t cores. Eventually > 6/8 thread gaming will be standard so 3700x is fairly future proof. I mostly game and do medium productivity tasking but even basic stuff I can sense some extra zip.

I am a content creator and use my PC primarily on 3D animation and occasionally game. I’ve decided to stick with AMD Ryzen R7 3700X since in my opinion is priced with the best value and provides a very decent performance compared to the currently priced Intel CPUs. I use Adobe Premiere, CS6 Photoshop for my editing use and Maya for 3D animation.
The 3900X is something that I wanted but I’ll wait in 2 years until the price goes down a bit for a potential upgrade in the future. Part of my new system build was based on my research from various youtube reviews and to be honest, the whole system performs excessively fast from what I am used to. The single-core performance is significantly improved and the multi-core performance is just simply amazing. I don’t think this CPU was overhyped and it does deliver what it was advertised. Some of the reviewers will argue that Intel is faster when it comes to gaming. That may be so if you use their more expensive CPUs but I would like to point out that the GPU will play a bigger factor in your gaming experience including the type of monitor that you use.
The included Wraith RGB cooler appears to be decent but I decided to install a 240mm AIO cooler. The 3200 GHz DDR4 RAMS have significantly dropped in price compared from 2017 prices. The use of NVMe just makes things faster when editing and processing.
If you are on a tighter budget, the R5 3600 would be a good value as well. I hope this helps.

6 Cores/12 threads
Came with free copy of The Outer Worlds
Cons: Runs hot (especially with the stock cooler)
Overall Review: Throw every impression you had of AMD from the days of the Bulldozer Architecture out of the window, as AMD just can't stop winning with Ryzen processors. With the best performances in their price range, the Ryzen 5 3600 and 3600x CPUs have very quickly grown AMD's CPU market share, while Intel's has stalled due to their higher prices with similar, if not worse performance.

This CPU offers 6 cores and 12 threads at an amazing price, especially while on sale. In it's price range, there's nothing to compare it to, except the 3600, which performs ever so slightly worse in every metric except power consumption and thermals, but with the difference in stock cooler that comes with each CPU, the thermal difference is basically negated.

The biggest problem with Ryzen at this point, along with most AMD CPUs, is just that they run hot. I'd recommend this CPU over the 3600 simply because it comes with a better stock cooler. That being said, my EVGA 240mm liquid cooler keeps this processor extremely cool, as even while under load, I've never seen the processor got much further than 60 C at its base clock speed, which is another thing to praise, because at 3.8 GHz, the base clock on this thing is certainly no slouch.

Couple this amazing CPU with the more than fair price and the fact that it came with a free game, (which I had already planned on buying) and you'll find that this is an extremely good deal.

1.5 to 2X computation in ALL workloads when considering clocks and IPC improvements. Compared to my Ryzen 7 1700 it replaced. WAY more L3 Cache 64 Mb vs. 16. Precision Boost Overdrive is incredibly impressive. I'm a decent overclocker, had my 1700 @ 3.9@1.381v running 140 watts. This runs 4.1-4.2 all cores when needed - and will boost 6 of the cores all the way up to 4.65 maxing at 120ish watts. Running 4.1 89% usage (mining, which is 2X+ hash rates) at 67 watts. Yeah. Gaming..definitely better, but I game at 1440P with Vega 56 - which is clearly the bottleneck now...11-36% CPU usage in most games (PUBG, Division 2, SOTTR).

CPU temps are great (I'm on 280AIO), but from everything I've seen...there's no need for an AIO)
Cons: Precision Boost Overdrive has really taken away the use/need for manual overclocks. I tried...4.3 all cores, nope...4.25 nope...and I ramped it up to 1.43v and that's where I said...any lower - and PBO is actually better. At least on the X370..

Please bear in mind THIS IS ON X370 platform..which brings up the other main issue I have - DDR4 support is still lacking on the platform. I was hoping to pop in the 3900X and that the new memory controller would make it magically do 3600...nope...not yet. This may change with additional AGESA updates IF the motherboard manufacturers continue support beyond launch day on the older platforms. I'll update if that's the case. Just buy cheap 3200 RAM if you're on X370. If you must tweak, tweak the timings on the RAM (which is a pain...hence why it's a con..they make you really work for those extra benchmark points!)
Overall Review: Am I bummed I can't overclock it manually?? Not really, not when I see the performance with PBO and seeing double the work done with HALF the energy. It's insane to say the least.

I'd absolutely recommend it for enthusiasts that don't have large PCIE requirements. Forget PCIE 4.0 - Threadripper platform is where you need to be if that's a concern.

Don't be an idiot, update your BIOS BEFORE you try to pop in a 3000 series in the older platforms.

IF you are on older platforms. Make SURE you have software to monitor your VRM temps. I have a ""12 Phase"" (Buildzoid would rip the 12 part apart) with 45A Chokes. The VRM can get insanely hot even with a decent heatsink. I bought a 140mm fan to directly blow on it. HW Monitor (CPUID) will NOT read my VRM temps..(motherboard specific??)..so I use Asrock's cheesy OC software just to get that reading(HW Monitor for everything else)..once the fans get that under control...we'll all be good.

Don't let PBO bum you out, really -the performance is so incredible, and AMD's engineers did such a good job with it(the chip AND PBO) - why complain...they get you a great chip that knows what to do when, at great temps and energy efficiency.",0.0,5.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Cons: I'm going to be real jealous when the 16-core, 32-thread Ryzens come out soon, but that's way overkill for me anyway.

The ""rated boost speed"" is just that, a boost speed. Do not expect to run at 4.5 GHz on all cores all the time and you will be happy. Some cores will be faster than others, but any core should be able to hit 4.5 for a short period of time. Don't expect do an all-core overclock like you can with an Intel CPU (you can, it's just not as high-performing and there can be stability issues).

Unfortunately, I bought a new X470 board and didn't realize I would have to update the BIOS before using this CPU, and 2 weeks and an AMD loaner CPU later, my computer is finally back up and running.

Cons: more cpu power equals more heat
Overall Review: this cpu is just jaw dropping incredible, and for this price range you cant go wrong. with this cpu temp
the only letdown is included cooler/fan, used the included thermal compound on the cooler and that was a mistake… but I gave it a try anyway
well nothing but heat issues and fan noise and erratic temp readings from temp sensor pin2, using cpuid hwmonitor I spotted the issues right away, tmpin2 would read 30 deg c then jump to 70 deg c
and the fan ramping up speeds to follow this, removed the cooler and replaced the thermal compound with know better thermal compound, helped out tremendously but I still get idle temps in the 42-43 c range
bottom line is great cpu, marginal included cooler.
*the following day I did some more research and found that turning off the core performance boost, and setting a manual fan curve kept it quiet and cool to 38 deg c @idle and a average of 52 deg c under heavy load
yes there was a slight loss in benchmark testing, but think the silence and stable temps are a good trade off

Haven't been able to see yet if I can tweak it abit more to drop the temps more. But my only ""con"" so far is that it looks to be certain aio copper plates like on the h150i might possibly not actually be as wide as it should be to actually have water across the whole cpu die, which technically isnt the CPU's fault.

At 1.4v on a corsair h150i running prime 95 it hit 112c with it set to extreme profile. With that said if you plan to buy this cpu you will need a beefy air cooler or AIO to handle the heat generated while under full load. At idle with stock voltage the cpu sits at 41c.

Overall Review: I built two systems in the last month. One has an Intel 9700K on a Z390 Aorus Pro WiFi, and the other has this AMD 3600 on an X570 Extreme4 WiFi ax. At stock settings for both, the 3600 outperformed the 9700K in CB R15 by a score of 1610 to 1560. After overclocking both, the Intel is outperforming the AMD, but not significantly, and at MUCH greater power consumption.

I researched in forums and videos for guides and tips on OC'ing with this new series of Ryzen CPUs. I noticed mostly claims that AMD's PBO has come along way and should be left to manage your OC. As an experienced overclocker and natural skeptic, I didn't buy it, and I'm glad I didn't because it's really bad advice and it doesn't make sense.

Any automatic overclock is always going to pump your CPU with substantially more voltage (and thus, power) than needed, because it needs to cater to the masses and employ a safe buffer. If you auto OC, your chip will get upwards of 1.45V at times. Obviously, nothing will ever compare with simply putting in a little time to test your chip at voltage/frequency settings and determine what it needs.

FWIW, my chip is locked in at 1.3V and 4.2GHz. The increase to 1.4+V to get to 4.3GHz was not even close to worth it for me, but suit yourself. But the most eye-popping thing about this chip was the meager power consumption. At the fixed OC of 1.3V and 4.2GHz on all cores, my MAX power consumption during a CB R15 run was UNDER 34W. I had to run it several times before I believed it. But alas, the max was 33.4W on CPU package. Meanwhile, my 9700K is pulling 155W while set at 1.25V and 5GHz all cores.

The Ryzen 3600 should be in 75+% of consumer PCs being built today. But I'm sure you'll find a way to convince yourself you need something more powerful. :)",0.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Good thermals. Mutch less hot than my previous Coffee Lake CPU.

The cpu run mostly at 4.350 Ghz with water cooling.
Cons: Need some adjustments in the Windows power management : minimal cpu activity was set to 90%
Overall Review: I bought this CPU to replace my Intel core I5-8600k. I was considering buying an i7-9700k.

The Ryzen 3600x gave me more than 50% improvements with less heat (20 degrees lower). It is faster than a i7-8700k.

I did not used the included air cooler. I hooked it to a 240 mm water cooling solution.

In games, I noticed no micro shuttering, wich was the case with my Coffee Lake.

perfectly sufficient for 1440p gaming (gtx1080)
probably good enough to stream without dropping frames(1080p@60fps) without needing a separate streaming rig although id recommend a 3900x for that just to be safe
Cons: not really a con since its BIOS' are still in their infancy but i havent hit the advertised boost clock yet with ABBA bios... 4341 is my peak on any one core. but im sure this next one will get it there
Overall Review: its a great cpu for the price. plenty of threads for a workstation, yet handles modern title games just fine. it doesnt run as hot as some people say for me with my h100 cooler. it idles between 35-40C and peaks around 70C gaming with the ryzen balanced power plan. but usually hangs in the mid 60s. perfectly acceptable temps. although case ventilation/flow makes a difference. im running the view71 RGB with 3 120mm intakes and a 140mm noctua exhaust on the rear and my h100 is top mounted with 2 120mm noctuas in a push pull with 3 140mm exhaust fans on the top of the case. the ryzen balanced power plan did lower temps noticeably. the room im in is probably in the 70-75F range.",0.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

I like the fact that AMD keeps using the same socket for several processor generations, making it easy (and more environmentally responsible) to upgrade the processor while keeping the same motherboard.
Cons: You will need an aftermarket cooler for any kind of overclock.
My processor seems to be from a not so good bin, auto setting to 1.45V at stock speed (MSI Tomahawk Max MB). Max speed is 4.2Ghz with ABBA Bios version.
Idle temp is 40C and reaches more than 92C (Win10 OCCT & Prime95).
If I had to do it again, I think I would go for the 3600X (or jump to 3700X as the price is getting lower) as the spire cooler is better and I also expect it to be better binned.
It did not work with Windows7 (well documented issue there are workarounds). That decided me to use Linux Mint as my main OS with PlayOnLinux for most Windows software and a VMWare virtual Win7 machine of my previous setup. The transition/migration went smoothly. Maybe this failure to boot Win7 is not a 'con' after all ...
There is way too much thermal grease on the cooler, you need to remove most of it (use the side of a credit card to do so). Installing it with so much thermal paste won't allow proper cooling and might result in the (conductive) paste spilling on the processor/socket. Idle temp should be between 35C and 40C. Anything above is abnormal.

Memory OC'd to 3200 using XMP profile right out of the box.
The turbo architecture built into the Ryzen series is fantastic for a person like me who doesn't overclock, but wants to get the most out of a purchase.
Boosting also isn't time limited as it is with the competition, mine boosts to 4.1+ GHz all-core all day long.
My copy with an NH-U12S turbos to 4.34 GHz in single core, and 4.12 GHz for Cinebench R20, temperature is about 32C at idle and 75C at full load. This is in a pure stock configuration with an x570 Taichi motherboard.
Overall Review: Fantastic upgrade for any system and highly recommended. AMD really hit it home this time, they have efficient, high-core count processors for their mainstream platform at relatively low prices. Can't get much better than that.

A reasonable amount of extra performance is available if you spend a lot of time to dial in your RAM speed and timings beyond the XMP values. The gains depend on the program and your ram settings, but gains far in excess of 1% have been reported. 3200MHz to 3600MHz seem to be the price/performance sweet spot, with better results given with tighter CAS timings. Make sure you pair this processor with high quality ram to get the most out of it!

This motherboard has seen a Ryzen 5 1600, the 2600, and now the 3600. After installing this new CPU, the BIOS reset itself, so I had to go back and change the settings to get it back where it was. That said, it booted into Linux just fine after BIOS sorted itself out (be patient on that first boot). I used the same stock cooler that came with my 1600, which I used with the 2600. Didn't even unbox the one that came with the 2600 or 3600.

I don't notice any 'speed' difference from a user point of view going from a 2600 to the 3600, but I am sure it is there. Started up VMs, Firefox, VLC, Etc. Everything snapped up as usual... Now to see how it goes over the next year or so until the next best CPU comes along :) in this category. I Don't game, so no review there.
Cons: For some reason, I am no longer able to read the temperature on the 3600 from Ubuntu. Was able to on the 2600, so something is different there. Suspect once the Linux temp driver catches up with the new CPU, I'll have it back.

Seems to run the CPU fan up and down a lot more than the 2600 did. I changed the fan profile in BIOS to help reduce this. The CPU looks like it may be running warmer than the 2600. BIOS is showing 38C at idle. The 2600 was usually around 34C.

{10/25/19 note turning off the boost mode in BIOS stops the fan from cycling. Even on the latest ABBA BIOS it still was an irritation. Mention just encase someone else doesn't care for it. Don't even notice any performance hit for the stuff I do either. }
Overall Review: Seems like a good CPU. As alluded to above, I don't see much difference coming from the 2600 to the 3600. Economically, I won't recommend it if you already have a >= 2600 CPU already. I got it because I 'wanted' it not because I needed it.

However if you coming from an older non-Ryzen system (like an older AMD processor or Intel) I'd highly recommend this as a good upgrade path. You won't be disappointed whatever Ryzen CPU you choose.",0.0,11.0,16.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: So far, I love this thing. I bought this around July 20th and built my full PC a week later. I haven't had an AMD PC since the Athlon64 days and I'm happy to report that this is awesome. This is my first PC build in 10 years, so it was quite an upgrade. I'm not trying to stream my games, or even play the newest, fastest games or even at 4K, so this thing does everything I need and more. It is super low power and hasn't gotten super hot on me. Either the PC fan is quiet or I haven't heard it get up to significant speed, as it produces 1/2 the sound of my old rig while gaming.
I do a little video transcoding for my Plex server and this things converts MKVs about 5x faster than my old PC (Intel 2500k). For example, I recently tested them both on encoding an MKV of my Blu-Ray copy of Avengers Endgame in 1080p.
2500k = 12hrs
3600 = 2.5 hrs
I am super pleased with this and it has run all the games I have thrown at it (and my new rig) at 1080p without issue. If cost is something you consider and you don't need the best of the best, give this a try.

Extremely fast in all applications.
Higher FPS at all resolutions.
All core overclock 4.4GHz (milage may vary).
Option to shut down cores or chiplets as you see fit (Ryzen Master).
Manageable temperatures with smaller AIO.
Very low voltage per core.
Very low overall power consumption.

I can go on and on but those are the major pros.
Cons: Have yet to find any faults with this processor. There is only one issue I have come across but it is a bios issue and it pertains to the motherboard manufacturer.
Overall Review: Overall this is the most powerful processor I have ever owned. I have had majority of top-end desktop processors including Intel. The 3900x is not the very top tier for the Ryzen 9 lineup however it fits my purposes. If you are looking for a top-notch extremely powerful processor and can't manage to get your hands on the 3950x and you don't need or cannot afford a threadripper this is it. It has been many years coming but AMD has ""RYZEN"" From the Ashes of the previous architecture and has managed to blow away the competition and a matter of a few years.

I found two solutions:

- Changing the power profile to max out at 99%. This completely calms things down, and makes the CPU run cooler too, but I guess it will impact performance a bit...
- Changing the CPU timing parameters in BIOS to wait longer before spinning up (and dwelling longer before spinning down). I did not change the fan curve, just these timing parameters (from 0.1 to 0.7 seconds). The idea is that these CPUs are constantly changings voltages (and temperatures) many times per second, and you don't want your fan to chase the voltages around too actively. This calmed it down almost but not quite as well as the 99% trick, but I stuck with this to preserve performance.

The other issue is that the fan is quite loud, or rather, has an unpleasant noise. Not just the ""swooshy"" noise that I get from my case fans, but more of a ""ball bearing"" noise. Not terrible, but noticeable. The CPU fan is a lot louder both idle and during gaming than the GPU fans on my Saphire Pulse 5700XT card, while doing a lot less work.

Cons: -If I’m nit picking, heat spikes
Overall Review: This was an upgrade from an old intel i7 4c/8t at around the same speeds I’ve had for years that I built for use in 3D modeling, and could also game. I went with the 3700 because while I feel the 3600 is great for gaming, I wanted a little more power for 3D work. I can’t speak to the effectiveness personally of the stock heatsink, but based on others experiences it runs well and can save you some cash to spend elsewhere in your build. Which is always nice considering I just toss intel stock fans into the trash as soon as I get them.

Anyways this new cpu in an Asus X570-I with 32GB 3600Hz RAM inside a NZXT H1 is performing like a champ. I’m seeing nearly double/triple render time improvements in my 3D workloads, and benchmarks. (Blender BMV test, Cinebench r20, Maya) As for gaming I got a 2060 super from a friend who was upgrading their GPU. I’m certain it is probably bottlenecking my performance, but compared to the card it replaced a GTX690 I’m seeing over 250% improvement across benchmarks @1080p and over 200% @1440p (Heaven, Superposition, Firestrike, Time Spy) but I’m getting sidetracked.

Coming from Intel or maybe I just never noticed then, but this chip naturally behaves differently than I’m used to. You’ll see temp spikes like every few seconds at idle, and your knee jerk reaction will be you messed up your thermal paste or need better cooling. Don’t start losing your mind over it. It seems like this is normal, and it doesn’t seem to have affected the performance in the slightest. These spikes drop back down within seconds. My cpu sits at 61 to 63 in games and workloads on the NZXT H1’s 140mm radiator, which I think is a little toasty for a water cooling solution, but it seems perfectly stable at those temps and doesn’t go above that even under a sustained load over 30 minutes.

It is a solid chip for those who want a little extra power for their workloads without shelling out too much extra money. If you’re just gaming though go get a 3600 and use the extra cash on your GPU budget. Better use of your money.",0.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: Overall this is a fantastic CPU for the average user that's going to game, surf, stream media, etc. It's also a good jumping off point for streaming and content creation.

Cons: Bugs with new x570 motherboards as well as older boards that have been flashed are a pretty rampant. Should have had more testing done prior to launch.
Also not a fan of them changing how they rate their boost clock from guaranteed boost clock to max boost clock without clarifying the change. Some of the marketing is misleading to say the best.

Overall Review: Currently running in a $50 Gigabyte AB350M DS3H motherboard

Updated to Windows 1903, updated Chipset drivers via AMD's website, updated Gigabyte AB350M DS3H Motherboard BIOS to F40, updated Radeon RX 470 drivers, dropped in new
Ryzen 5 3600 CPU, Enabled XMP in BIOS, done.

At stock speeds, I am getting higher single core scores (481) in Cinebench R20 vs. a stock Intel 7700K.
At stock speeds, I am getting higher multi core scores (3530) in Cinebench R20 than an 8 core, 16 thread AMD 1700X

CPU-Z bench (stock speed): Single - 518 / Multi - 4115

CPU-Z stress test all cores boost to 4.2 GHz / AMD balanced power plan.

Teamed up with an RX 470 and game play at 1080p is noticeably smoother than with a Ryzen 1600 - probably due to the massive amounts of cache on the chip.

Temp Idle (stock cooler) 37C

Temps while gaming hang around 66C-71C with stock cooler.

Still figuring out all the new features with this CPU, and have not tried overclocking. Will update when I have more info.

Idles 34-38C using an aftermarket Cooler Master MasterAir MA620M, Arctic silver 5 thermal paste and good old case fans, no water inside my PC thank you.. Have yet to see this go over it's highest spike of 72C thus far.. that is stress testing on burn in under 100% load installing benchmark files, downloading games and running rainbow six siege maxxed out completely over 70FPS on RTX2070 8GB at the same time.. I was almost worried about other reviews saying this processor gets hotter than the sun, they must not have used proper thermal paste, a real shame on such an expensive piece of hardware that should last a long while at stock temps. Just my 2 cents though, everyone knows stock CPU coolers are never ""adequate"" for decent temps.

67C peak locked at 60FPS with Resident Evil 2 Remake cranked at AS ULTRA as it can go with CPU handling HALF the 16ish GB VRAM it said it required thru the MB and that was with 3 case fans not spinning yet (forgot to buy a fan hub) and thermal paste still in first 24 hour break in cycle. VERY GOOD for me as low temps aren't a contest, just overkill for over clocking which this chip does NOT need at all, more than enough IMO... Windows loads in 10 seconds off m.2 enough said.

2. Free game 8D
Cons: Only 1 free AMD sticker :( could have had more cool stickers but that's ok I guess. The beautiful packaging makes up for it so all good :)
Overall Review: Recommend 100% EVEN IF it just fails right after I write this because there is always less than 1% chance a CPU may fail in the first 48 hours, it's not down to bad hardware or manufacturing in those rare cases.

Comes with stock cooler.
Great price.
Cons: Does not have integrated graphics.
Overall Review: I've owned mostly AMD before and have never had the nightmare issues you hear about from Intel enthusiasts. That being said I have owned my i7-6700k for four years now with no issues. I went to build a new PC for streaming and running some programs so as not to weigh down my current gaming system. While in the market for my new CPU I looked at a wide range of CPUs from both Intel and AMD and came to the conclusion that if you want the perfect amount of value from price to performance AMD is definitely the way to go. the Ryzen 5 3600 competes directly with Intel's 6-core i5-9600K. While Intel offers a good performance as well it just cant beat the pricing of the Ryzen 5 3600. Stable out of the box and I'm not looking to overclock. So this was perfect for my build offering a great performance solution without making my build bulky and expensive.

No product is 100% flawless and some people may have issues that others do not. My goal is to provide you with an unbiased review of this product in my eyes. I do believe that this product The AMD Ryzen 5 3600 overall is a great product and a good buy.

For the TL;DR people out there my reasoning for choosing this product was:
Low cost - High performance.
Support and Compatibility with both DRAM and MoBo.
6-Cores & 12-Threads (better for larger workloads vs a dual/quad core system).
Overall high satisfaction from the community.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

- reasonable power consumption
- amazing value
Cons: - none
- if you value low noise and temps invest in a good AIO liquid cooler
Overall Review: Read reviews that this processor runs hot so I built with a AIO liquid cooler (Corsair H100x) instead of the stock AMD wraith cooler.

Monitoring temps - I generally read about +5 degrees Celsius at idle (versus ambient) and +25C with intensive use. Have yet to record a temp above 60C (+35C over ambient).

Power consumption given performance is excellent - leaves plenty of headroom for GPU with reasonable capacity power supply (I chose 550W).",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Cons: The included cooler is not great, I would advise that you buy an aftermarket CPU cooler to get optimal performance out of this CPU.
Overall Review: This is the CPU to get in 2020. It is ideally placed for future-proofing your system with its 6 cores and 12 threads. It may not be the fastest, but with the new consoles coming out with their multithreaded CPUs based on the same Zen 2 architecture, developers will really start to take advantage of the cores and features offered on this CPU.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

-High OC potential (Was able to hit @4.6 GHz)
-Single thread performance improvements lead to being strong enough to outcompete 2700x (8 core) on some newer games!
-Works out of the box
Cons: There are virtually no cons with this product. It's the final, refine version of the Matisse chip, and a good one. I guess the only complaint is that the difference in performance between this and the original 3600x are very slight, and most of the gains come in the stability of the architecture over years of use, and not necessarily raw frames.
Overall Review: I love this processor because it is the anthesis of a ""budget build"" item. This processor is a little too expensive right now to be good deal for anyone trying to get the best performance to price ratio. For a little more you could get the 3700x with more cores, or even the 2700x for less that would still generally perform better most of the time (even some intel options could be cheaper). What's great is that this 6-core processor is just plain good. It's not a good ""deal"", it's just a good solid product with refined manufacturing processes and high stability with overclocking if you ever need to. I highly recommend just getting this to flex on people who are obsessed with budget building ;)",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Runs pretty much every modern game no problem. CPU cooler handles the job, RGB is a nice touch. Stays decent temps at 4.4 even under load. Decent heat sink with copper pipes. Good air cooler.
Cons: 4.4 is the brick wall here. You might be able to eke out about 20 more megahertz if you win the chip lottery but don't expect to go much higher than that. Even at 4.4 its insanely fast and can handle everything modern. Overclocking on these zen2 platforms is more about how fast you can get your ram to go for some reason, XMP profiles and all that. But other than that it runs well
Overall Review: Its capable of a lot of things, multitasking, video editing, graphic design and cad art, music production, playing modern games at 2k and 4k resolution (although a lot of that will play on how well your graphics card is) but even the cpu can help make up to some degree in several games if you're upgrading from an older system and have 570s or 580s for example and are holding out for the next rdna release before you update your graphics card, this cpu works well with those cards and will probably work very well with the new navis getting ready to come out, but if you're holding out on graphics card upgrade I'd say stick to 1080p or 1440p for now until you can get a card that can handle 4k without slowdown.
I'd say this processor is impressive. It exceeded my expectations, I thought it was going to be a slight incremental improvement over the 2700, but its really a lot faster than the 2700, I suppose the die shrink makes all the difference, 7 nm. Its impressive, worth a try if you're looking for an affordable yet powerful upgrade.
If you get this though I do recommend very good DDR4, 3200 or better, and at the very least rx 570s and a decent b450 if you are looking to build this on a budget, but i would wait on graphics card major upgrades until the next rdna release of navi by AMD.

OR

you could wait until the AMD 4700 APUs are more widely available, which the 4700 will basically be the 3700x with a graphics processor in it and less l3 cache to make room for the gpu",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

- Not a huge power consumption
- Includes an RGB fan
- Very solid performance
- Hyperthreading
Overall Review: Summary:
It's fast, modern, smooth, worth the upgrade from any 4-core CPU and YES it is a night and day difference. I have this paired with 16GB Ram and an RTX 2060 Super. Temperatures are completely fine if you have good air flow.

Wall of Words:
I switched over from an overclocked i5 6600k intel processor with 4 cores @ 4.2 speeds (so my fan made less noise than 4.5). In many games or activities I found my CPU being hogged by everything with 100% usage, FPS drops, stutters, etc.

With the addition of more Cores and Hyperthreading my games have never been smoother (less FPS drops, stuttering, etc.) . Still testing games and their performance now but the recent games I've been playing have had quite the difference in FPS. Everything is judged by the previous CPU being at a 4.2 overclock and the new cpu is at stock speeds.

[Performance]
I don't even joke when I say I get about a 10-25 FPS boost in my games now, some areas are close to the same performance at stock speeds while others are 20-25 FPS higher on average.

Red Dead Redemption 2 feels incredibly smooth now in comparison to my last cpu going from the 40-50 range to 60-70 range in the open field with High/Ultra settings and in town at night time (Saint Denis) when all the lights are turned on I was around 25-32 FPS and now I'm in the 50s and I feel no hiccups. I did turn up my lighting and shadows to ultra from high since I didn't see why not with the new cpu.

Monster Hunter World is around the same with the approximate range of +20 FPS and doesn't seem to dip in performance when I'm in the heat of battle or near demanding areas in the open world. A much better experience playing.

Assassins Creed Odyssey I don't have an active FPS displaying while playing but I checked the in-game FPS monitor in the menu. The performance gain is around the same again but the big difference is I'm going from a medium/high setting to full Ultra and feels fantastic but towns big enough can still put me in the 40s only it still feels quite solid. If you know anything a bout AC games they are extremely heavy on the CPU. So in other words I'm getting a huge boost in performance here.

[Temperature]
I had a cooler master hyper 212 evo for my previous CPU cooler and was reaching an average of 59C in demanding games while this cpu runs at about 69C in games with the stock cooler. Completely acceptable but actually runs up to 74C when running other tasks that don't involve gaming sometimes. The Idle temperatures are no issue at all and sits at 36C if I'm doing nothing.

This Ryzen 3900x smashed my i7 7700. I upgraded my mobo/cpu/ram. 7700 on previous Asrock board was good with no issues, so i stayed with Asrock (B550). My upgrade path has been both Intel and Ryzen at some point. I went from 8350 - i5 7600k - i7 7700 (non-k) to Ryzen 3900x. By far price sucks...but i wanted to try it out. I feel like not enough reviews are on youtube & up to date. I notice smoother higher fps in games. I was thinking my gtx 1070 was out of date, but once i put this cpu (could be ram/mobo) on it, it pushed it further, and its surprising. i.e Most games 20-40 fps gain, no lie @ 1080p 144h monitor.(i do run 3 monitors 27in, but game on 1)

I am totally on sold on Ryzen hype train atm... made my gtx 1070 (evaga sc) a beast again.

Overall Review: There is absolutely NO NEED to over clock this CPU, the onboard boost makes this thing a BEAST and the stock cooler is more than enough to keep this thing cool ( and the RGB fan on the cooler is very cool ) Haven't done a lot with it yet, but what gaming I have done I'm getting 100+ fps on ultra settings and no temps over 60c ( I have 5 120mm fans in a micro ATX case, 3 intake and 2 exhaust ) and this thing runs ice cold even under extreme load.

- Best passmark-per-dollar currently on the market
- Provided that motherboard firmware is up to date, Just Works
Cons: CPUID on this chip incorrectly reports support for the RDRAND instruction. The instruction is unsupported, and every invocation returns 0xFFFFFFFF. Most kernels know to check for this and avoid RDRAND, but some software (and some TLS implementations!) still uses it. In most cases this can be worked around and in some cases there's even a bios patch for it. Still, it's good to know what you're getting into. This was the *only* drawback to this chip, but it's a pretty serious one.
Overall Review: This chip continues to demonstrate the extremely large price and process advantage AMD has lately over Intel. It's very noticeably fast for CPU-intensive tasks and games that can benefit from more ILP; you wouldn't expect an FPS jump in Tomb Raider but I got an FPS jump in Tomb Raider of all things. It may be worthwhile to check with your motherboard manufacturer whether there's a bios patch for the RDRAND issue, but honestly most people won't even notice even if there isn't, because of the good library and kernel support.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Was able to push 1080p x264 slow quality when using it as a dedicated streaming Pc or 1080p medium/sometimes slow encoder settings when gaming and streaming at the same time. 900p x264 slow encoder settings all day.
Cons: Lower clock speeds compared to it's Intel counterpart which will affect Fps but the difference is not that significant that it really matters when considering how well it does at multithreaded tasks.
Overall Review: I got this Cpu and paired it with an Asus x570 motherboard to use it as a standalone streaming Pc. I couldn't be more pleased with it's performance! When streaming alone I was able to set the quality to 1080p x264 slow encoder settings with some games, 1080p x264 medium encoder settings is a breeze. 900p x264 slow encoder setting it can do all day and that is what I mostly use since Twitch caps bitrate at 6k for non partnered streamers. I've not done much testing yet as far as gaming and streaming at the same time but it should be able to do 1080p x264 medium encoder settings pretty well. I seem to have won the silicon lottery this time and was able to do an all core overclock with a fairly low voltage. I recommend using an aftermarket Cpu cooler though, whether you prefer air or liquid cooling. I'm using a 360mm Aio and that really keeps the temps in check but a beefy air cooler or 240mm liquid cooler should do the job as well. All in all this Cpu does what I need it to do with ease so I couldn't be happier, until Ryzen 4000 releases. Lol",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Probably would anyway, but I wanted to save for something good and have been running it with the stock cooler. The cpu hit 95 c not overclocked a couple times while gaming. Though normally it tends to hang out around 65-75 under load.

- Jumping off the first con, the cooler is only alright. For the most part it does the job but for extended periods of time or cpu intensive work/games, it will struggle to keep temps low.
Overall Review: I would definitely get this CPU! Its completely turned my whole system around for the better. With the new XTs coming out (and the benchmarks seeming marginal) the savings you'll likely get to performance is more than worth getting this. If you're looking at this, you're probably going to get an aftermarket cooler regardless so the stock cooler drawbacks and high CPU temps are (hopefully) a non-issue for you. However, if you're thinking the stock fan will get you by, be weary depending on what you're doing. While playing AC: Odyssey my machine shut down do to high temps on the CPU. Its only happened once and I've played the game plenty before that, but I'm going to wait for the cooler to get here before I continue playing that.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

I do video editing and this really cuts through them. i was using an old laptop to do my editing and things that would take an hour get cut down to around 15 or 20 minutes.

Every game i've been playing runs well at high or ultra high graphics with other settings turned on as well. I get good FPS in games and it's all clear and smooth.

The fan it comes with is decent as well!! i do plan on switching it out within the next couple of months but this is very servicable. I get consistent temps and i've had it peak at around 70 when doing intense game, but i rarely reach that height, usually staying around 50-65 C.

No heating issues and perfect for gaming as it will run any games with the right GPU(will not discuss frame rates), most will go into tech specs and might convince you to buy higher level processor, will don't do so as this is a good start and will last for long time.

Overclocking is also really easy when using Ryzen Master. I've had no experience overclocking any processor before, but I was able to achieve a stable 4.3 GHz on all cores with 1.325V.
Cons: The included cooler is nice, as it means spending money on an aftermarket cooler isn't necessary. However, if you are planning on overclocking, I highly recommend getting one, as it will give you more headroom and improve your temperatures, which can in turn extend the lifespan of your CPU.

It is a con and pro, but it doesn't use 96% of my CPU on one game anymore, CPU is not overloaded but due to the amount of cores, single application speed is waned compared to the stronger cores with Intel, but still an amazing processor.
Overall Review: It really comes down to what you want between this and Intel's latest, you spend a hell of a lot less for 10% single application performance and gaining the workstation aspect where you will almost never overload this PC and cause it to slow down.

Overall Review: Ended up taking the fan from the new heatsink which has a higher rpm, and slapping it on the old heatsink which has a vapor chamber. Barely breaks 60c under load. As far as gaming, it has improved fps in every game over my 1600, about 15-25 on avg for games like GTAV, A.Creed, Rage2, Farcry and such on the same GPU (evga 1070). Some games like Rust and Ark, see a 30+ fps jump. I recently bought a 32"" 185 fps curved monitor and the 1600 was barely breaking 70 fps in alot of games. Now I can really notice the monitor shine. I'd buy it again in a second. Was gunna wait for the 3300x but availability is nowhere to be found and this 3600 is more future proof. Can't wait for Cyberpunk 2077.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Everything runs great and have no problems with hit.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,0,1

Cons: Runs a little hotter than I would like
Stock cooler was a little tricky to get aligned properly
Overall Review: This a great CPU, installation was a little tricky because the screws on the cooler weren't all at a convenient angle. This made installing it a little more hassle than I would have liked. The thermal paste comes applied to the cooler which is really nice for getting it right.

It does run a little hotter than I would like. It generally is sitting between 40-50 degrees Celsius when it's not really doing anything. The highest temp I've seen so far is 81 C. However for a stock cooler and paste, it is quite quiet. I typically don't even hear it running.

It handles multiple programs quite well. I'm able to run games that are extremely CPU intensive without issue, while also having a web browser with 30 tabs or so open at the same time.

Major point often missed with AMDs are the included coolers. 3700X has a better cooler than 3600X (Wraith Prism vs. Spire/Stealth) that does an awesome job keeping it cool, for zero extra spend (and fully controllable RGB if you hook it up via USB connection).",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: Review edited after receiving replacement chipset (original would not seat properly)

To keep it brief, along with the summary points above, this is a 4-star review because it is a pricey chipset which has not beaten my previous PC's benchmark (it was an Intel). However due to competition, I am intend on supporting AMD and had to support my view with my wallet. The review also factors in the frustration of needing a replacement chipset.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: So far, this processor had been an excellent purchase. At idle it maintains a steady state of 35°-38° and under load, peaks at 55°. This is all while using the wraith prism cooler included with the processor. The peak speed I've seen so far was a very brief touch a 4.4ghz.
As far as the cooler, it is quiet and more than adequate for the processor. It has speed select right on the cooler to choose between high and low speed as well as the cables to program the addressable RGB that's built in.

- Good for gaming.
- More virtual core than what most people really need.
Cons: -It seems to run hotter than my previous 2600 and 1500x on same operating condition, i.e. under H60 watercooler radiator.
-Support the PCIE 4.0
-I recommend a after market radiator, as a H60 seems maybe the minimum, so the stock radiator is probably not enough, but i have never tested it/
Overall Review: -Cheaper than Intel equivalent processor
-AMD SMT technology is more performant than intel HT.
-Very large L3 cache.
-For gaming rig, i think AMD is the way to go, for processor at least.
-I am using this with a Sapphire Vega64 and 32 Go 2400MHz double channel RAM, and the Radeon is the bottleneck on every games.
-The main issue about multicore processor is not the processor itself, it's the lack of software optimized for parallel tasks and the very bad understanding of thread amongst programmer community. We have the processors, but not the software.

Cons: Thermal behavior is wonky. When I was using the stock fan it was constantly spinning up and slowing down. It was very distracting.
Overall Review: Upgraded from an i5 3570. I was really into Cities Skylines at the time and was having performance issues when my cities grew past a certain population. I thought this 3700x would help but it turns out Cities is poorly optimized. At least I'm future proofed for a while now. This processor hardly goes over 20% utilization in the games I play. I wasn't very satisfied with it initially because the fan was always spinning up then slowing down. I tried adjusting the fan curve but the behavior still persisted. The temp graph in Ryzen Master shows why, it has a saw tooth pattern of spikes. The temp is constantly fluctuating by about 6-9C. My plan from the start was to eventually water cool and now that my custom loop is installed, the computer is whisper quiet and the 3700x never gets above 70C even when it's crunching for Milkyway@home or Einstein@home all night.

With this CPU I can push out 1080p/60fps stream with zero dropped frames and still remain within 20-25% CPU usage.

a 5 egg rating since the performace is still great.
p.s PBO is a good tool to use only downside of it is its only allowing one core to get a higher clock speed the way it was designed. you. youll be better off manuly overclocking it to get more performance compared to PBO. unless you have a stock cooler then i would use pbo.

Usually stays on 4.3 GHz depending on the cooling
It is literally what you'd expect from an Ryzen 3000 series. Really good performance with minimal issues.
Cons: I dont have an issue with the CPU my issue is with the stock heatsink. It is too loud and if you read bellow you will see my experience with it.
Overall Review: I have been using this CPU for the past four months never had an issue in terms of performance. The only issues I have with it is the CPU cooler. I decided to use the stock cooler for a couple of months so I can save up and buy an Aio. When I was trying to clean the PC, I unscrewed the CPU cooler the back plate came out but the CPU cooler wouldn't. I ended up just pulling on it and the CPU was completely stuck on the heat sink. I think maybe because AMD use cheap thermal paste on the CPU cooler that happened to me. Luckily no pins were bent and I just removed the fan, Heated up the heat sink with a blow drier for 5 minutes and eventually the CPU came off unharmed. I would defiantly recommend this CPU but I would rather go for an after market cooler.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

as far as gaming, and every day tasks, this is a HUGE upgrade from a FX-8350, and i mean HUGE. i really think this cpu is ""de wey"" (dead meme) for a 6 core cpu. itll handle whatever i can throw at it and with the Neptwin V2, im not worried about any temps, ever.",0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

- RGB fan!
Cons: - The fan has two RGB colors -- the fan, and the fan's outer ring. When using the motherboard RGB control, the outer ring cannot be customized, so it rotates through the RGB colors. It would be nice to have an ability to customize this color as well. This is a small con though, since this most likely can be customized from the software with another input cord to the fan.
- Fan mounting is a little weird to put on, but this is quite a small con.
- My cpu is almost ineligible to be overclocked - I turned it up only to 4.0 ghz from 3.9 ghz, and even that small increase continued to crash on load of Windows 10.

- It’s got a stock fan (If you’re not overclocking you don’t need to buy a cooler) I can run Minecraft with SEUS PTGI great with cool of 59-79°C
- Ryzen Master is your “Core Temp” and overclock handler
Cons: - As far as I know, you can’t run Hyper-V on Windows Pro and overclock the CPU or launch Ryzen Master (I don’t overclock, but this is something to be aware of)
Overall Review: AMD performance with their CPUs is a good budget. I had originally used Intel, but in recent I wanted to give AMD a shot so my first gaming build includes this. I’m beyond blown away that you can do somewhat more and run more things. The stock cooler is great for anyone who isn’t overclocking and just wants to save money, the fans not loud.

In this case, it's the Matisse and this nic actually describes how fast the ram can be that it supports. In this case, DDR4 3200 is maxed speed that's not overclocked! It can be overclocked to run speedier ram up to the Mobo makes specs in most cases 4400mhz. The other item to pay attention to is it's PCIe Generation version supported, in this case it's generation 4.0
Cons: You would think the differences between the Ryzen 5-3400g and the Ryzen 5-3600X would be almost the same except temps and wattages, 65watts vrs 95watts! The differences are quite nominal! The processors with the internal Graphics gives away to performance such as Ram speeds, the ""g"" models provide video but a the expense of ram speeds lowered to DDR4 2933mhz. Do read up on your AMD processors, it's not like the previous AMDs socket AM3s, the AM4s differ quite radically!

They have the poorest instructions to acquire your game. I did not get mine. AMD needs to box their processors better.

Board upgrades to higher end processors make this a steal for budget gaming and workstation.

Auto overclocking is usually maxed at 4.4ghz with water cooling.

Manual OC through BIOS is stable at 4.6ghz on water with core voltage of 1.39.

Temperatures on water block are stable between 39 and 56C at full load on 4.4ghz auto and between 41 and 58C at 4.6ghz.

Framerate on Intel heavy games is drastically closer now. Negligible differences in framerates on most games now.
Cons: AMD overclocking software is trash.

The usual finicky games tailored for Intel, not really a con, but the framerate fans will always ding it.
Overall Review: Smooth upgrade from the old 4790k. Water cooling throughout, so overclocking is easy through the BIOS. Forget about the software that AMD provides as you need advanced physics, trig and calculus to figure out that abysmal interface.

With a good board and great cooling you can overclock well.

Cons: Patiently waited for an affordable upgrade to my old system, coming from Sandy-bridge (2500K), which was an admirable platform by Intel but its time has passed. I have been with Intel for the past 15 years and didn't really look at AMD since the old Athlon classic days (1999). But Intel's offerings in the past 4-5 years have just been so lackluster, and by far too overpriced. Their sense of overall value and lack of innovation simply showed that they didn't have the best interest of their consumer-base, moreover, their greed took precedence. Unfortunately, Intel's greed and complacency has left them in the dust, still on 14nm.. And they're upcoming release 'Comet Lake' is still on 14nm, just laughable. Competition is always a good thing for the hardware market, and if a company doesn't see it coming, they'll lose that crown pretty quick.

ZEN 2 is truly the next step in a well-rounded system CPU and should provide enough computing power in both multitasking and gaming for many years to come, and at an amazing price-point!

Overall, very impressed with AMD's comeback in the past few years and their willingness to keep affordability and the consumer in mind. Bravo AMD!
Overall Review: - First 7nm architecture!

Total system power draw dropped by about 15-20W going from the 1600X to this. I found that while previously on my Ryzen 5 1600X I could get DDR4-3466 running at CL17 with some aggressive voltage, the 3600X had no issues with DDR4-3466 CL14 (other than a pretty nerve wracking long restart to apply the settings).

- Cooler, quieter, and much faster than previous CPUs
- Supports my DDR4-3466 CL14 XMP profile
- New tuning options available for power/performance optimization by the user
- Cooler included* (see cons for more info)
Cons: It's hard to find something I don't like about this CPU. It was such a painless upgrade that I really have no problems with it. If I had to pin something down it would be the downgraded Wraith Spire cooler that it comes with. While it's nice to even have a capable stock cooler available, the original Wraith Spire was a copper vapor chamber design that does keep temperatures down a bit better in confined cases like mine.

ATTENTION: The Wraith Spire mounting design CAN put too much pressure on your board and cause the system to not POST if you have an older board. Some newer boards have a different CPU backplate that fits the design spec for the Wraith Spire, but older ones (specifically in my case, Biostar X370) the backplate mounting 'stems' don't come up through the board far enough and trying to wrench down all four screws on the cooler will create too much pressure and keep your board from booting. I found this issue when I first built my system in 2017 and it still holds true with the newer Wraith Spire design.
Overall Review: I would recommend this to anyone in the same position as me; someone who bought first gen Ryzen for an ITX system and now wants to jump to Zen 2 without having to ditch the ITX form factor and go X570. If you also have an X370GTN know that with the latest UEFI it will work right out of the box with Zen 2, if you've got an ITX or any other X370/B350/X470/B450 board be sure to check the support page for your board first and see if it's supported.

Overall Review: Just received this today and am impressed with the packaging by NewEgg. Ryzen box itself is nothing to write home about, but is nice enough to display if that’s your thing. Comes with the massive Wraith PRISM air cooler which I will never use, but others may find it useful. As with previous Ryzen CPUs, they are packaged well and include the traditional Ryzen decal. Just ordered my x570 Crosshair VIII Hero today as they just came back in stock. Once I receive the aforementioned mobo I will update my review.

If it matters to others I am upgrading from a Ryzen 5 1600x paired with a ASRock Fatality x370 Pro Gaming that has given me zero performance issues productivity/gaming wise.

Lastly, I’ve read reviews across multiple vendors about this being Out of Stock more often than not. It may not help everyone, but I did utilize the Auto Notify feature to great success.

@NewEgg - I would suggest making more of these CPUs available as stand alone purchases rather than include them in bundles.

Low Power
Included Cooler
Great all-rounder for Streaming, gaming, and Content Workloads
Cons: Decently high temps even on AIO.
Overall Review: In this section I will talk about my overall experience upgrading from my r5 2600. To start with installing the cpu to replace the 3600 was easy and straight forward because its obviously the same socket. BIOS update i did on my AsRock b450m Steel legend worked like a charm.

HOWEVER, upon booting up into windows with the new cpu installed windows only sent instructions to 6 of the 8 cores because it thought the 2600 was still in there forcing me to reinstall Windows so buyer beware you may need to wipe your pc to a clean install of windows 10.

Next lets talk about temps and RAM. Temps even on a 120 coolermaster AIO at 4.1ghz 1.3V at 100% load it will stay at 73-77 Celcius, nothing too wrong with that but its not cool either. I am running a 32gb kit of Corsair Vengance rgb pro ddr4 3200 cl 16 and it ran at 3200 using XMP on the 2600 but not on the 3700X, i am forced to down clock them to 3000mhz (oh well).

Conclusion: Great cpu performance wise, had to wipe pc and reinstall windows, ram compatibility is sketch, temps are high-ish. but overall no complaints.

temps and core voltage are all over the place. CPU-Z reporting voltage anywhere from .90v to 1.440v on the CPU and Ryzen Master is reporting 10c to 15c jumps in temp at idle. while these may just be reporting errors from software that will need to be updated for Ryzen 3000 series chips.

run memory at 2133MHz and remove the second GPU and its stable for me, your mileage may very though.
Overall Review: This processor has been a mixed bag of good and bad. It was an upgrade for Ryzen 7 1700 that worked flawlessly in my current system.

Overall Review: In general the 3600 is a good CPU and worth the money. I was disappointed that the max boost that is advertised is not easier to achieve and reached more often on the stock cooler or with a AIO. Overclocking much at all lead to high temps. Overclocking to max boost ran toasty at load and anything past was very hot a on even with a 240mm AIO. I bought it replace my 4790k OCed to 4.6ghz with 2400mhz RAM which was starting to age to the point of needing a lower OC soon.

Trashes my old I7-4790K like it was an 8088. I stream live videos of games, and tend to have a few windows (4, to be exact) open in the background to allow that. Idles around 29-30 degrees C with a Corsair H100i V2 doing the cooling job. That's with a fresh application of Arctic 5 Silver beneath the pump. Uses the vertical line application method. It will only get better as time goes by. I think the highest temp seen was on single processor, around 58 C. And didn't stay there long. So that should give you an idea about it's gaming performance. Seen some say the processor would never hit it's stated MHZ, but they need to look into either buying a MB made for this CPU, or update their BIOS badly. That is my opinion on that. My performance logs says it does what it needs to do, speed wise. Performance wise, I couldn't nor would I want to OC this CPU.

Overall Review: I owned a AMD FX-8150, and a FX-8370. I was annoyed when it was shown that these CPUs were not providing true 8 core productivity. They did do okay, but recently I was seeing more need to upgrade. Recent reviews from LTT, and Jayz2cents, helped me decide that an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X would be good choice. Reviews on Newegg also helped to reinforce this.

The Ryzen 9 3900X preforms very well. I got a Gigabyte X570 Elite, and there was no problems save for getting the memory to post at 3200. Everything runs fast, and quite well. I hoped to keep using Win 7 Pro, but I lacked the skill to make that work. I can truly multitask now, and games run quite well. Top temp I have seen was 70C, and that is rare. I have a 240mm radiator AIO waterblock cooling and it keeps the idle/low usage temp at 20C to 40C.. Currently let the stock OC boost do it thing, and have 3.8 GHz to 4.2 GHz on all cores.

Outperforms all but 10 other CPUs for single-threaded performance. (the 3600x is the only other chip within $100 that beats this for single-thread in that 10, $150 if you exclude the sole server CPU)
Cons: The cooler is barely adequate for this CPU. (it really should've defaulted to the Spire, like the 3600X, or not included one at all)
Overall Review: Currently sitting at the top of my recommended gaming CPU list for anything less than $2500. If you have a higher budget than that, get a 3800X, as it's top of the single-thread performance chart, and gaming benefits from single-threaded performance quite a lot, even if it's multi-threaded optimized.

Definitely want to get an aftermarket cooler for this. A GAMMAXX 400 is easily sufficient, and will top you out around 75°c if you're doing something very wrong. Shouldn't break 70°c if you have everything set right and run the fan at effectively silent speeds.",0.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

The Ryzen 5 3600 has more or less the same single-core performance and much faster multi-core performance than the nearest equivalent Intel CPU, the i5-9600KF. The 3600 is cheaper than the i5-- and the 3600 includes a cooler which you have to buy separately for i5-9600KF.

That said, if you want to overclock, the i5-9600KF is probably better choice. The included cooler with the 3600 barely keeps temps under control at stock speeds, so you'd need an aftermarket cooler, removing some of the price gap between the 3600 and the i5-9600KF. Also, online reviews seem to indicate the the overclocking ceiling is much lower for the 3600 than for the i5-9600KF.

I've never built a PC before and I got into doing research just as the Ryzen 3000 was announced. I decided to not get the 2600 and instead waited for this to release.

Installation wasn't difficult and after I updated my MOBO Bios, it booted right up! With the stock cooler and having not changed any of the overclock settings on the CPU, I had an average idle temp of 51c and during gaming i usually saw a constant core clock boost of 4000-4200mhz with a CPU temp of 70c, depending on the workload of the CPU(PBO activated).

I just installed an AIO and the average idle temps are 36c. So now, while gaming, the CPU is almost always giving me 4200mhz and holds steady around 46c.

I literally just installed the AIO, so once I get into some heavy gaming I'll check the temps and report back!

and i manged to solve it and change the thermal with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut and its so good and the highest temperature under full load is 70c with the same 3.9 OC

Overall Review: I immediately tested my cpu at SiliconLottery's binnings to find my CPU is in the bottom 25% lol. No big deal. I got my CPU pretty well dialed in on a MSI B450M board.

Using the Wraith Prism, I'm running it at 40.25x @ 1.21v, 24/7 ALL CORE. After playing with the fanspeed curves and in a 22c house, it idles around 38-41c. Gaming loads are 55-65c depending. Prime95 small ffts with AVX ON seems to equalize about 85c. Fan speed curve is essentially: 40c @ 50%, 50c @ 70%, 65c @ 100%. Couldn't fit a bigger air cooler in my case, but the Wraith Prism seems pretty well optimized for this chip, anyway. It's basically quiet for loads under gaming. I don't live in a library and game with headphones, though. This seems to be the sweet spot. Yeah, yeah, i know AMD is working some black magic to balance some cores running at +1.4v and blah blah.

-Faster than you'll need for a while. Hasn't had to go above 40% for me on the most demanding of tasks so far.
-Easy-to-use boosting software. X570 mobo compliments it perfectly.
-Included CPU fan heatsink has been awesome--also has neato LED options (I did use my own Arctic MX-4 compound before installing it). I will be replacing this with my H115i Pro liquid cooler as soon as my new full tower arrives though.
Cons: -It's not slow?
-Does not boost to 4.6, don't even bother. ""Extreme Performance"" mode through Dragon Center kicks it up to 4.1, and that's all I've ever needed, tbh. This CPU will be good for a while with stock settings (as opposed to silly manual OC settings that people meticulously setup for nothing other than benchmarking--ie not real gaming).

Cons: None
Overall Review: I bought this chip as a calculated upgrade to my 4790k. The pricing on this 3600 and Asus Prime x570 p bundle made the cost of the upgrade a no brainer. I decided to make the move now because the 3600 is an upgrade and cheap. More importantly I'm waiting a couple years for the Ryzen 5xxx series so I can buy the appropriate 4xxx chip cheap. I'm hoping to stay on this platform the same 5 years the 4790k carried me.

If you are looking to upgrade from 4790k these are a few of my experiences:
My SSDs are SATA and SATA performance is faster with Intel
4.7 4790k was faster on single core although the 3600 at 4.2 is close.
3600 faster 2 cores and above.
High FPS 1080p gaming is better 3600.

Great for gaming, regular computer use, and both at the same time.
Cons: This thing is a thermal nightmare maybe i have a bad chip. But im not happy with the temps I am seeing. This cpu is running at 4.2ghz and currently being cooled by a 240mm cooler master water cooler. And idle temps as im writing this are between mid 40s and high 50s, when gaming it stays between 60-75c. It has reached dangerous temperatures many times(95c). And tripped the thermal shutdown i configured in core temp.
Im an experienced builder. Everything is assembled as it should be, My case has adequate airflow and the thermal paste has been properly applied. The motherboard chipset is an x570, the cpu has a more then adequate psu
I would really like for AMD to get into contact with me regarding this issue and shed some light on the situation because none of this makes sense to me.
On a side note i have an fx6300 @4.2 on a 120mm cooling system and it runs much cooler and has more stable temps. And its way more power hungry and hotter then the ryzen series

Really happy that AMD is shipping units near their max performance so I don't have to spend the time doing it myself.

Although I would have liked to gotten a higher tier CPU this will fill my needs just fine. In the end, I chose this because the lower TDP for a SFF build.

Overall Review: I switched back to AMD on my last build (2700X) after running the other brand since mid 2000s. I use to love AMD and do again. I have had a lot of cooling issues with both my 2700X and 3600 and was only able to fix the cooling buy disabling the ""Precision Boost"" mode. I think if you are not running a liquid cooler the heat is just to much.

Overall Review: The 3600X is a significant performance upgrade over my i5-3570K which served me well for almost 8 years. The 3570K was really starting to bottleneck load times in newer games and I couldn't be happier with this upgrade. Much faster load times and less lag.
I found the unit easy to install. I'm familiar with changing out most PC components but I'd never swapped out a CPU/motherboard before. After doing some research I installed the new motherboard, popped the Ryzen in and re-activated windows. Everything was good to go no hassle.
I had seen some reviews saying that the 3600X runs hot, for me it's idling at an average of 35C and maxed out at 65C under a heavy load, which is fine.
The stock cooler isn't loud per se but has a distinctive whine that kind of sticks in my ear.

- Comes with an RGB Cooler
Cons: - Runs HOT!
- Comes with a mediocre RGB Cooler (Loud and poor thermal performance)
- Included cooler has so much thermal paste on it that it pours over the sides of the cpu after its installed
- Not really ""plug and play"" like most Intel cpu's I've used.
Overall Review: I'm mostly happy with my switch back to AMD after many years of sticking to Intel cpu's, but this switch has been a bit of a (mis)adventure. I don't tend to muck around with overclocking, at least to any extreme degree, and as such I've usually just used stock Intel coolers when buying a cpu that comes with one without ever having a huge problem by doing so...

Enter the 3700x. I decided that since I didn't intend to overclock I'd just stick with the included AMD cooler since it looks nice and even had RGB right out of the box! Firing up my new computer I was a bit alarmed to see idle temps @ ~50c and upwards of 83c under load (ambient of ~21c).Thus started a long journey of trying to remedy the high temps. First I switched to Window's ""balanced"" mode, to pretty much no effect. I then followed some advice from the internet and installed AMD's proprietary chipset drivers so I could use the ""ryzen balanced mode"". This also did very little (maybe a 2c difference at idle and load). After myriad other attempts at fixing this problem with software settings, fan curves and voltage settings I finally decided to go the hardware route and picked up the biggest Noctua air cooler I could fit in my case (NH-D15, single fan mode), paired with some highly recommended paste from various overclocking forums (Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut). Temps became reasonable after that, sitting at around 26c idle and ~65c under heavy load.

TL:DR - This cpu runs HOT, HOT, HOT. If you plan on using this in your build make sure to get a really beefy air cooler/AIO and the best thermal paste you can find. The stock cooler just doesn't cut it for anything other than light use.",0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

AMD please release supportive bios for b450 and x470 motherboards for the upcoming 4000 CPU's. Its not fair to us who invested in B450 motherboards that have 32mb rom and capable vram to run even 16 core OC CPU.... The Tomahawk Max is in no doubt a very capable motherboard and I would like to be able to upgrade in few years to 12 core 4000 series. Do the right thing AMD and treat us right considering we also buy your GPU's to go along with the CPU and we have been your customers for decade at least...
Overall Review: The CPU performs excellent, I'm lucky if I get to stress it to 50% considering it has 8 cores... This thing even at stock settings at 3.6ghz it clocks constantly fluctuates up to 4.4ghz on all 8 cores and I'm doing nothing with the computer, hence the title of my review a CPU with an attitude. Lucky me I got the Tomahawk Max board and the software allows me to choose balanced mode and keep the CPU at steady 3.6ghz, I went into bios to see if there is an option for choosing balanced option or any option to keep it at 3.6ghz but no dice, so trough software after booting I can choose balanced setup and all cores stay at 3.6ghz. No issues with heat either but I'm using Scythe Ninja 5 which is a hefty and large air cooler, so no problems temps wise even if the CPU goes on all 8 cores 4.4ghz under load.

Overall Review: I've finally went team Red...loving this CPU, bought it to upgrade from an i7-3770k, for gaming/editing/streaming. Heard tons of great things about it, and the price couldn't be beat imo.
Upon completion of build and first boot, the first thing I notice is the BIOS telling me my CPU is running at 77c. Never had a CPU run that hot without a load, so, 2 days of troubleshooting and googling, finally got temps i'm comfortable with.
Note to AMD, a public disclaimer; preferably in video form, explaining that these cpus are designed to run hotter, should've been considered. If I could get this thing to idle around 30c, and stay under 75c full load, i'd be much more comfortable with running it.
Perhaps closer meetings with motherboard manufacturers, instructing them to set stock auto voltages at a more normal level, instead of the ""CPU Frying"" levels of voltage you get out of the box, would work better.

Outside of the temp issues and no real fix in sight other than to undervolt/downclock/buy better cooling, and this chip would've absolutely knocked it out of the park. 9/10 AMD, loving it.

Docked one egg for temp issues, and the fact that first time builders could potentially kill their systems before they even get to use it.
I've been building and tinkering with these things for many years, and up until yesterday, never had a CPU hit 100c...this chip hit 102c, and I about had a heart attack.
Hopefully just a bios issue that could be fixed with an update, not holding my breath.
Other than that, absolutely outstanding. More chips like this, at this price, with better thermals, and i'd definitely consider sticking with AMD.",0.0,3.0,9.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

I'm posting primarily to warn people about THE con, so please see that. When I bought (March 2020), this was probably one of the best performing CPUs for a reasonable price.
Cons: The stock CPU cooler fan is obnoxiously loud. I was confused and concerned upon initial boot of a fresh build (all new stuff). I have been using Fractal Design cases for my last 5 builds because I like build quality, and they have all been quite quiet. Not so with this monster.

The fan noise was so prominent I thought there must have been something defective, or maybe a poor application of thermal paste. But checking the reviews confirmed, this fan is way too noisy.
Overall Review: I hope this review helps others looking at AMD right now. Any that have the Wraith Spire cooler will have the same trouble, and you should seriously consider the noise problem.

When I ordered, I had no idea about this thing, and didn't even look to see if there was an option to buy without a stock cooler. Since then, I checked, and it appears you cannot. So build in the cost of a cooler to the price of this CPU. Seriously, I would suggest you do not even test the stock cooler out, just buy a quiet cooler and toss the stock one out. I went with the Cooler Master A71C, and that operates like a CPU cooler should, quiet and cool.

In case the other components might be helpful, here's the rest of this build: GIGABYTE X570 UD, MSI Radeon RX 5700 XT, CORSAIR RM Series RM750, Fractal Design Focus G, G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 16GB, Crucial P1 1TB 3D NAND NVMe, WD Black 2TB, and Windows 10 Home.

Overall Review: I had an old quad core I7 3400ish non and this noticeably better in some ways. my frame rates in games are unchanged at the resolution I play at but if I open a browser and stream audio and look codes its just as fast running those web pages as if I didn't have a AAA running in the back ground and my frame rates don't drop with Netflix running a movie while I game. I'm not very good at games and I don't patience or time to git good. So im running the witcher on easy with a walkthrough open and it used to take 20 seconds to switch windows not its like 1/2 a second. but the witcher used to run at 68 FPS at 1440p and now it runs at 69 fps at 1440p with the same video card. I was lead to believe I would see a 20% improvement or so framerate increase because old cpu was a bottleneck that didn't happen. the whole thing is much quieter and sleeps and hibernates perfectly which the old system could never do and all around seems to be a lot more slick. is every bit as good as a quad core i7 and bench marks says its a tad faster than a 6 core i5 in everything that matters. I don't have any heavily threaded workloads that would make this a better choice than the intel 9400 and the cost with mb and stuff was basically a wash. AMD boards cost more and usually so does the ram. I'd buy it again as I expect future games and stuff to trend towards better multithreading.",0.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,0,1

Overall Review: I’ve been gaming as my hobby on a PlayStation since 1996. The reason I build a PC was because of ryzen hype train was real and I had jump in and experience the PC world. My build is:
Ryzen 9
X570 msi Meg ace
32gb G.skill royals at 3600mhz
2TB M2.0 gen4 by corsair
Radeon 5700xt

Now this my first build so I can’t say anything about the older stuff or competition. But I really love everything about ryzen 9 and all the parts I bought. My PlayStation will always have a place in in my heart, but this PC is now my multiplayer machine. Later in the future I will consider a monster GPU knowing the cpu and motherboard can handle it, but now the 5700xt can do everything I need while I learn to mess around with the pc",0.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

- games very well at 1440p
- runs at sane temps unlike some recent Intel parts.
Cons: - the advertised max boost clock is unobtanium. It will run at about 4400mhz single thread at the most, and that's with a high-end Noctua air cooler on it.
- the supposed 3600mhz sweet-spot for ram is also a joke. Get 3200mhz and save yourself some money.
- Not really an enthusiast part inasmuch as overclocking is a complete waste of time.
Overall Review: Could be a 4-egg review, but knocking it down because of the misleading core speed advertising. Overall quite good, but the advertised max clock speed is a joke apparently, and there's no headroom for overclocking (much less AMD's own autoOC)...",0.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Doesn't get hot.
Cooler in the box is all you need unless you want to do something in particular.
Cons: Core 8 is dead on my PC. I've submitted an RMA with AMD and it has been the slowest experience I've ever had to deal with.

I was getting constant BSODS on the Windows desktop at an idle and on stress tests core 8 and it's extra thread would sit idle. MemTest showed erros on ""core 14"", which is core 8 due to SMT. After a few different kits of RAM I would still get errors. Isolating MemTest to just Core 14 would cause an instant crash. I've sent this info to AMD on Sunday and was asked to send a screen shot of the error, I did so Monday morning and a few days later I have not heard back. I may be calling my credit card for a charge back as this is unacceptable.

Also never hit the advertised 4.4ghz boost clock on a single core. I'm not sure what kind of opportunistic environment this CPU needs to do so but a Gigabyte X570 Master and a Corsair H115i RGB Plat with Kryonaut as the TIM couldn't get it past 4.35.....

Confirmed working RMA/GPU from another computer didn't fix the issue.
Swapping MOBO with one sourced locally didn't fix the issue.
A friend letting me try their Ryzen 3600 in my exact setup confirmed my processor was dead. When my processor was used in their setup, it didn't work.

So, worked for two days. Then died in the middle of light gaming (Grim Dawn).

This is my very first time ever migrating from Intel to try ANYTHING from the red team, and I have to say I'm fairly disappointed. Will update my review once I see how the RMA is handled, and if the new CPU lasts any longer.

Compared to Intel's offerings at the price point, this is slightly worse for single-core performance and a good bit better for multi-core. Gaming varies based on how many cores a game is designed to use, but usually Intel will do better in gaming while AMD will do better at work, or at gaming while doing other things such as streaming. It's a great CPU for doing work and almost certainly won't be the limiting factor in your games.
Cons: DOES NOT BOOST TO 4.4 GHz. Period.
Straight out of the box, with the stock cooler? Nope.
Slap on an NH-D15 and turn on PBO? Still nope.
Try to manually overclock? You're not getting close to that.
I don't mean it'll only do 4.4 on one core, or only 4.4 briefly, it WILL NOT do 4.4 AT ALL. Highest I have ever seen is 4.3, and even then only for fractions of a second. The performance is still great, but I expect honesty about what the CPU can actually do.
Voltages were VERY high out of the box, all the time. If you close absolutely everything, and every background program, the voltage will go down. If ANYTHING is open, it'll boost to 1.45V and stay there ALL. THE. TIME. As a result it runs VERY hot (60C under an NH-D15, and oddly will actually REDUCE to 50C with a moderate load on a few cores) I manually locked it to 4.1@1.2V and now it idles at 40C and only hits 60C when using all 8 cores at once.
Power consumption is great under load, TERRIBLE at idle. With the stock settings, according to AMD's own software, it's drawing around 40W with 5% usage. Put on a heavy all-core load, and it'll maybe raise to 70W.
No overclocking headroom, if that's your thing. You can lock it to a certain all-core speed and maybe gain 5% improvement over stock in all-core loads, but you won't get any more single-core performance. This is good because it means you get a great CPU out of the box, but if you like overclocking, there's not much to gain.
Overall Review: Overall, the CPU performs great. Hopefully the high voltage/power consumption/heat at idle gets fixed, I'd give it 4 stars if that gets fixed, and a 5 if an update lets it boost to the advertised clocks. Manually locking the clocks to 4.1 GHz fixed all of its problems and it performs just as good as it did stock, so if you do purchase one, tweak around and find a stable clock at a nice, safe voltage. I don't know if the voltage really is dangerous for the CPU (some people say it's fine at idle, some people say it's not, nobody really has any proof aside from the fact that nobody's has degraded much yet)
Oh, and the XBox game pass thing is useless. I didn't even bother to redeem it, it's annoying to redeem and doesn't really get you anything aside from a slight discount on some games. I'd rather they just chop a few dollars off the price. Or give a free game like with their GPUs.",0.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Cons: quality control - my cpu came with a ever so slightly defective memory controller that randomly blue screens when running at the supported 3200mhz ram speed on a ram kit and mobo that also support said speed that worked perfectly fine on my previous 2700x without issue. BOSD's disappeared once ram speeds were dropped to 2133mhz. Since so much of ryzen 3000's performance is tired to its infinity fabric and ram speed i am RMAing my CPU.

artificially removed windows 7 support- as someone who still prefers windows 7 to 10 in my daily use cases i was very disappointed when amd dropped win7 support for the 3000's series. even for older motherboards that worked fine with win7 for their 2000's series cpu. furthermore amd tried to force it not to work on win7 by simply not updating the hardware id's for the onboard USB controller in the device driver rendering all rear USB ports unusable in windows 7.

Overall Review: **Previous setup was 1700X @ 4.2Ghz (1.35v) in Asus X370I w/ GSkill Tridentz 2933 cl4 B-Die stable @ 3200Mhz **

With 3600 installed, cannot run @ rated B-die speeds, any other speed including 2133Mhz results in system instability and Windows hard freezing minutes in the OS... HWInfo sensors indicates the crash happens right as it hit's the 4.2Ghz boost speeds. Manually setting bios at modest CPU clock speeds resulted in failed posts at various speeds between 3.8 - 4.2Ghz (still 2133 and 2400 mem)... each time required cmos reset. No degree of bios config results in a stable system (running Win10 1903)

Seems likely due to Asus X370I compatibility specifically (note: bios updated) or memory controller issues, though I had figured 2933 B-die would not be an issue.

I'm an avid AMD fan and supported ( I own Zen 1700X, 1920X, VII and RX cards and love them all)... HOWEVER, I felt the need to convey my experience to those users with 3** series chipsets to be aware of potential issues or incompatibility.

Cons: - Platform leaves a lot to desire in terms of stability
- Many applications, Load times, and context switching noticeably slower than higher single threaded performance CPUs.
Overall Review: On paper, and under ideal circumstances, this is a pretty good CPU and when its on sale, its a really good deal, (despite my misgivings).

This is my first AMD CPU and I still stand by my decision to buy it given the great sale price when I purchased it. That being said, doing things like alt-tabbing and switching to different applications is noticeably slower than other builds I have and didn't really meet my expectations. However, once in the application (e.g. a game) things run pretty well and the odd hanging moments when context switching are pretty easily over looked.

Another new issue I've never really run into before in other products is really bad driver support and odd behavior from the platform as a whole. Randomly audio devices no longer function, applications crash often, and BSODs have become at least a weakly occurrence. These problems have persisted even after a motherboard swap and OS reinstall. Further, it seems that drivers and even BIOS need to be updated frequently and can often result in performance or stability regression until another update down the road. In my previous experience with older builds, I can't remember updating a driver for the chipset and/or CPU after day one, and definitely have never needed a BIOs update after first install ever.

Overall, the ownership experience due to the apparently instability of the product and its accompanying platform has been a bit poor. When things all run smooth, its great. If you're wanting something low maintenance, look elsewhere. If you're willing to keep up on driver updates and occasional BIOS flashes then definitely look for a sale, as they are pretty frequent.",0.0,4.0,15.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Good single core performance, excellent multi-core performance. Easy on the the power bill, only 90W peak.
Cons: Have to nitpick to put stuff here. Don't like that AMD didn't filter the CPU temp at all. It really jumps up and down fast on load and unload. They should use a hardware filter on it. Don't like the CPU having pins that can get broken or bent, should have pads like they do on Intel CPUs.
Overall Review: Super happy with this CPU (3700x), great value. It's considerably less expensive than a comparable Intel CPU. I paired mine with an X570 motherboard. I do have a power consumption complaint with that chipset, but this is not a chipset review. Still it's companion to the CPU. Anyway I great great benchmark scores and the CPU never peaks above 70C. Idles about 8C above room temperature. That's with a compact Noctua NH-U9S cooler in a rackmount 4U case that's not particularly well ventilated. What's not to love about that.

Generally peaking under load its 4.3ghz under load with default BIOS settings, AGESA 1.0.0.4 patch B. Came with a good game bundle over the 3600, worth that alone to me.
Cons: Its only as fast as stock 8700k, if thats even a con.
Overall Review: Honestly stepping up from a 2600 to the 3600X was roughly a 20-25% boost. But where it really shined was certain DX11 titles that the 2600 struggled with, although the FPS were fine, there was definitely some sort of lag happening. I found it better to just leave the settings alone in the BIOS, no I&amp;#39;m not comfortable with 1.4V, but the highest CPU stress only used 75W, most times its around 40-50W playing games and what not. 3 big reasons I went with the 3600X, higher boost clocks, lower power usage(box cooler determines the products TDP, from my understanding) and free game. The price difference is the game alone, for a game I would actually buy, and I just didnt want to start overclocking. After my 3.75Ghz R5 2600 compared to a 2600X boost clocks, didn&amp;#39;t want to chance it honestly. Pleasantly surprised to see clocks around 4.35-4.4Ghz for the most part. From my understanding AMD CPU&amp;#39;s are binned by power usage, the 3600X uses an incredibly small amount of power for the performance it delivers. I was at a cross roads, do I buy a 2700X for a little less or a 3600X with 2 less cores? Considering the 3600X is slightly worse at multi-core work loads and I still play a lot of DX11 titles that really on single core performance, I feel it was the right choice. The 3700X did cross my mind, but 75% the cores for 66% the price made too much sense to me, also I knew I had a better chance of higher all core frequencies, and that was what I was after. Also the memory Fclk(infinity fabric) for this one is 1866, some are having luck with 1900, but not for me. Matches nicely with DDR4 3733, which in most cases AMD approved DDR4 3600 should do relatively simply, as long as your MB likes higher speed memory, so choose wisely.

Cons: First CPU must have had a short
Second CPU was overheating right from the start.
Contacted AMD and of course they say it's not normal to have it that hot. maybe they should test their CPUs a little bit better I have been without a computer for quite a long time and lost a lot of time with LTT and the folding at home program. Now I am concerned about the chip itself. I haven't had such problems since the phenom 2
Overall Review: I've gotten two chips so far. First one started off perfect on idle which was 30° c but the moment I put any kind of load on it it would spike to over a hundred and I had to quickly turn it off before the chip actually would hit the 98° max. The second chip started off at 50 degrees Celsius on idle and then would jump to 90° c with load in a very cool room. An unheated room in the end of winter.

So I bought the 3600 on sale and got it cheaper than I paid for his 2600. On build day we got everything together and fired it up and to my dismay the mobo started kicking out error codes before it would even post.

Swapped out to my son's 2600 as he was thinking it was a BIOS issue with the 3600 that is known to happen and everything fired up smoothly and the machine ran great. Followed all the required troubleshooting steps and swapped back to the 3600 to test, same error codes as before. So I have RMA it and wait to see what happens next..

Will update once I get the replacement back and or it works.

Update- RMA processor was a bad one as well. I have now returned the processor and motherboard and will start the process over, maybe with intel this time. Thanks newegg customer service, you have been the bright spot in all this!

1. Windows doesn't red-line my cpu just from all my startup trash
2. Went from xmxs to 1m7s to compile the linux kernel
3. Handles any game I throw at it without issue
Cons: Absolutely absurd amount of thermal paste on the reference cooler! I opened the box, and looked at the underside of the cooler and thought ""boy howdy, that's a lot of thermal paste"". Regardless, I installed it, because I didn't have any thermal paste of my own.

Day 1, this sucker's doing it's best jet plane impression every time I open a browser. I work on this computer for 8 hours a day, and about every 30 seconds WHOOOOOOOOOOSH just because I right-clicked on a window.

I downloaded CoreTemp, and saw that it was idling in the mid 60's C, which is absurd. I threw Prime95 at it to see what the max was, I had to turn off the tests after a few seconds because it was blasting past 80C and seeing as these have a lower recommended temperature than most CPUs, I didn't want to burn it out.

I ordered some new thermal paste and remover on here, took the cooler off, and of course... The paste was squeezed out in every direction, getting on the CPUs actual PCB, and even onto the motherboard. I had a hell of a time removing it, and was worried it might damage something, because it was even getting into the CPU pins.

I cleaned everything thoroughly, and replaced the stock paste with just a little rice-grain drop. Reinstalled the same cooler, and now it idles in the mid 40s, and maxes out at around 70C.

TLDR: LUDICROUS AMOUNT OF THERMAL PASTE. Do yourself a favor and replace it immediately if you intend on using the stock cooler.

Overall Review: This is a decent board, but I would only recommend that you get it if you have multiple TB 3 devices that are critical to your regular workflow. Plus, the Intel Fan mount is kinda awkward to use on an AMD board. Once you have everything running, it is pretty decent, but I had several hiccups along the way that kills my recommendation to someone wanting to build a high end system.

You will need an Intel compatible aftermarket cooler (My spare stock Intel cooler I had to use didn't cover Ryzen IHS or provide decent cooling for my 3600. Mistake on my part).

I also suggest that you make sure your case has USB 2 ports, otherwise you are only left with USB 3 and SATA ports. Wouldn't suggest it if you wanted to be part of the early adopter's crowd with no USB 3 gen 2 header.

BIOS update tool refused to recognize USB 3 flash drive that I formatted to flash the bios with even though it recognized it when formatted for windows installation. Took an hour until I finally got the flash drive to show up in the BIOS tool. It was only made worse because the Wireless AX driver refused to work until I got the BIOS to update for some reason, and since I move my system a lot, I was about to go to Newegg right then for a replacement. Wireless has been good since then.

P/S 2 was DOA. Checked the splitter I was using and checked with a couple different P/S 2 keyboards. Nothing, no lights, no input, nothing. Kinda sucks when I want to use my Model M13 for working at home. All the USB ports and SATA ports were good though.

Still have an unknown ""base system device"" in device manager. While this could be fixed by using the included CD with drivers (Points for including that BTW), none of the downloaded BIOS or driver updates fixed this issue. Currently waiting on a Blu-ray Multi writer I ordered from another site so I can try the CD. This may also be the source of some weird bugs I am having (black windows, loud fans, and one where the computer went to sleep and wouldn't wake up)

If I didn't have to work from home and if I didn't need it for my drafting workstation and if I didn't need it to finish finals, I would have returned it and bought a Mini DTX motherboard from ASUS instead. I also have unfortunately just missed the deadline for returning the board, so I guess I am stuck with it for now. Research your hardware guys! An extra 5 minutes now can save hours or even days later! That's how I got myself into this to begin with XD.

This board is good, bit there are some kinks I would work out before continuing this line. Add USB 3 gen 2 header. Perhaps provide a usb stick with the loaded drivers guaranteed to work instead of relying on having a CD drive. Maybe even bundle with a compatible cooler to make the experience a little more user friendly. Things like this can really make or break the user experience for someone like me on their first computer build.",0.0,8.0,174.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

No need to run benchmarks as I'm happy with the performance for my needs. I rarely overclock and based on other reviews, the 3700X doesn't provide much benefit in overclocking the CPU.
Cons: a corner CPU pin was slightly bent or tweaked where it didn't just fall into place on the board. Normally the CPU mounting process is quick and literally they just fall into place when aligned. In this case I saw a slight rise on one corner and it wobbled. I pulled the CPU out and after sitting it upside down to see if it was warped and looking at the pin formation under a magnifying glass I noticed the one corner pin. I was able to take a needle and very meticulously urge the pin into a slight alignment. Then mounting the CPU was tricky as I needed to be sure the corner was in without causing damage to the other pins. Let's say it was a snug fit. I was overjoyed and too happy that it was in and working that I just mounted the stock heat sink without much review. This is when I found the pre-applied thermal paste was excessive for my standards and extruded past the CPU and onto the board. This causing me to start over again in addition to cleaning up the paste.
Overall Review: I've historically always bought intel CPU's and have grown accustomed to certain standards. my first venture into AMD processors was a bit of a miss.

Cons: -high idle temp (see below)

Overall Review: In terms of performance, I absolutely recommend this product, however there is one thing that buyers should be weary of:
After installing, the fan on the cooler would ""woosh"" constantly (it would alternate between about 60% and 100% PMW) and i would get constant temp spikes, causing the Temp to fluctuate between about 45C and 55C (google ""AMD sawtooth bug), this is caused due to issues with AMD's automatic core boost. I resolved this issue by disabling Auto Core Boost in my BIOS (GIGABYTE X570 board) and adjusting my fan curve. Now it idles at 40C and the fan is much quieter.
Ultimately I was able to solve the issue and the processor works great, but AMD's stock settings have issues, so I can't rate this product 5 eggs. Still would recommend.",0.0,0.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

Performance doesn't even stutter if you add transitions or color correction. I'm typically five layers deep, this CPU doesn't even flinch.

I record webcam, mic and gameplay footage at the same time to 2 separate SATA SSD's, don't even need to worry about a thing.

Worked fine out of the box, no problems, totally stable.
Cons: Does suffer from a little gaming performance compared to even the Core i7 4770K that I upgraded from. In some games, at least. I know for sure in Dirt Rally 2.0 this Ryzen 9 absolutely SCREAMS (when you use Ryzen Master and put it in ""Game Mode"").

This CPU is flexible, but you have to tell it to game using Ryzen Master if you want it to have better all-around gaming performance. And even then, some games will be slower (like GTA V).

I say if all you do is gaming and light work loads and you're still packing an Intel Core i7 Haswell (4770K) or younger, there's still no reason to upgrade yet.
Overall Review: Didn't even take the included Wraith Prism cooler out of the box. Re-used my Noctua NH-U12A air cooler. I've never touched the fan controls, idles at around 55 Celsius, loads at just over 80 but the fans haven't spun at 100 percent either. They automatically ramp up to keep it around 60 during medium loads. One of these days I'll tweak it to be louder at idle and more consistent.

I installed Ryzen Master, allows you to switch between Creator Mode (all cores, stock clocks) and Game Mode (6/12 cores/threads, OC). I leave it in Creator Mode all the time. Works fine, never skips a beat.

I also have to use Ryzen Master to set the memory speeds on my X570 mobo. Confirmed in CPU-Z the mobo doesn't clock the RAM to 1,600 MHz (DDR4 3200) by itself (1,200 by default... eww.). Your mileage may vary in that regard.",0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

I'm not positive I could get more stable speed than this with my sample, with any amount of volts (I have tried some, not much). I get great scores on any benchmark I use, and, more importantly, I get over 75fps (my monitor is 75hz) in any game (Though, in my ""real world"", I do have some dips below in some games, but only because I use 4xeq supersampling on almost all games I play, nothing to do with the cpu).
I use crossfire, and i believe the cpu is more important in sli/crossfire setups. I upgraded from an R3 1200 (I had it at 3.9ghz, 1.5 volts), which was a minor improvement overall (but certainly not in every way) from my trusty (4.8ghz) 8350. Both upgrades, which i did within a couple of months of eachother (the 1200 was a stopgap to afford the mobo and ram, and not have to wait for the cpu, essentially), made significant improvements to my fps. The 3600 has surpassed the cpu bottleneck threshold for my system, and probably therefore most any system out there.
Cons: I bought this with the xbox game pass, which is cancer for your pc (i installed it, and it got very... shady. It isnt worth installing to play older games like dishonored 2, trust me. I had to uninstall it to stop it from downloading that specific game (though, it would be the same for any game on the platform, we can assume), because simply uninstalling the game didnt keep it from continuously restarting the (hard to locate) download... it is typical microsoft ""all your pc's are belong to us"" bullsh*t. avoid taking advantage of that. I didnt buy the cpu for that reason, but it's almost like a virus attached to software, if you don't just avoid it.
Now, the 3600x comes with borderlands 3, which i would totally pay 40 extra dollars for... but it's too late for me. Also, the 3600x probably has greater all core capability (similar to the 3.4 to 3.6 ghz upgrade you get in single core boost performance when you get the 'x').
The moral of the story is, be patient, and buy the part you actually want. And never look at that item again on newegg. I am still 100% satisfied with my purchase, just wishing I had the current deal being offered.

Cons: The entire process to redeem the included-with-purchase code (Assassins Creed Valhalla at the time of my writing this) is an affront to good customer service practices.

-When receiving the code from Newegg, you first have to register an account on the AMD Rewards website.

-Second step: enter the code in the Rewards website, which will then prompt you to download their Product Verification Tool program installer. Be sure to use FireFox to download this, as it seems using chrome or edge will cause issues with the installer.

-After installing the PVT, you then run it and once again enter the code you already entered on the website, and then proceed to watch as you're greeted with one of several error messages or issues that prevent any further progression.

-Next, you go back to the AMD Rewards website and send a support ticket with included purchase invoice, and then spend the next couple of weeks enduring several back and forth emails with some of the most unhelpful customer service I've experienced in a very long time. Each successive email in this chain of several emails will make clear that no one is actually reading and paying attention to what you had initially reported as being an issue; you will be given the exact same troubleshooting instructions multiple times even despite your already explicitly that said instructions were followed without success.

-If a miracle occurs and AMD eventually helps you successfully troubleshoot the issue and allow for the Product Verification Tool to successfully confirm what they should already now know thanks to having already received your proof of purchase of an AMD product, you will next receive from the PVT an secondary redemption code.

-Your next step involves going back to the AMD Rewards website and verifying that second redemption code, which is itself a multi-step process that leaves more opportunity to run into an issue.

-If you are finally able to successfully redeem the second code, AMD Rewards website leaves you with the following message: ""We will update your account and notify you as soon as the content key is available.""

After all that hassle and frustration, you are left with a mere promise that AMD will provide you with a working code, eventually. A promise that is difficult to take seriously after seeing elsewhere online that AMD Rewards usage is a widespread problem for a great many customers.
Overall Review: Prior to this incident I had been a longtime AMD supporter, but thanks to this experience I no longer care how well-made or capable their hardware might be; the entire ordeal in dealing with AMD Rewards has convinced me to stick with Nvidia and Intel hardware for my future purchases.

AMD is welcome to try and redeem themselves and retain me as a customer, but I doubt they even care about pleasing their customers when considering how they handled this matter.",0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

I've recently been streaming on Twitch with next to no issues at all the only being is that I am terrible at pc gaming...been on PlayStation for years. I am able to run every game I've played so far (includes games like CoD: Warzone, Apex Legends, CSGO) all on high if not Ultra settings without any issues. Mind that this is all not overclocked because I'm not confident enough for that.

- Cheaper than my old Intel processor and twice as powerful

Cons: - No mention of the need to install AMD Chipset Drivers or AMD Ryzen Master software for accurate temperature readings. The randomly high temps were what concerned me. After a bit or research I found that it's observer bias with some software combined with out of date chipset drivers and purposeful self-boosting design that lead to abnormal temp readings. Easy to manage, but AMD needs to include that stuff in their documentation.

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Hannah B.,Ownership: 1 month to 1 year,Verified Owner,7/28/18 22:37,4.0,"Pros: Build Experience
-Great layout on both sides of the case.
-Ample space for good cable management, lots of tie down spots.
-Enough space to top or side mount most 240mm/280mm AIO radiators.
-Removable power supply bracket (held in place with 2 captive screws) that makes mounting the power supply super easy.
-Removable SSD mount located behind the motherboard. It comes off with 1 captive thumb screw and allows you to easily mount your SSD's with the included super small screws. Once you are done you just reattach the mount to the case. This is much easier than trying to line up the small SSD mounting screws in the case.
-It somehow ""feels"" compact for an ATX case, but building in the Meshify C never feels cramped.

Design Function
-Front mesh panel allows for great airflow intake from the front.
-Top of the case comes with a mesh cover and a hard cover. The mesh cover allows for fans to be installed at the top of the case, and is held in place with magnet's. The hard cover snaps in and out with a little applied force. These kinds of options are what make this case one of the best at this price point.
-There are three included Velcro tie-downs that can handle most of your big cables and keep them out of the way.
-The tempered glass side panel is is held in place with tool-less thumb screws. Not having to reach for a screwdriver (butter knife?) or alen key every time you need to remove your glass cover is a sign that Fractal pay attention to the WHOLE user experience.
-Overall the build seems sturdy, the tempered glass is inline with the quality of higher end cases, and is unsurpassed in airflow at this price point.

Design Aesthetic
-There are five different versions of this case. Dark tempered glass with a HEAVILY smoked out glass window for those who like the look of a glass side panel but aren't really sold on the whole RGB 'till infinity theme in their case. The regular tempered glass version that is more inline with with the rest of the industry when it comes to glass side panels (that also in an mATX version). And my favorite version, the black & white. It can go with a wide verity of color schemes, and it add's a real ""showcase build"" element that you can even make look great with off the shelf parts. There is also a version without a tempered glass side panel (traditional solid metal side panel) for those of you who don't really like the TG look, or who are looking to grab this case for a few $$$ less.
-The front mesh panel has an angular design that Fractal claims ""maximizes"" the incoming air flow. I personally like how it looks, but that's obviously up to the individual.
-The tempered glass comes with a border painted on the inside of the glass. Again, I personally like this. It adds a border to your showcase, and in the case of the white model, It can make finger prints around the thumb screws less noticeable.
Cons: Build Experience
-The top IO is attached to the whole front panel. When removing the front panel (which is held in place with plastic snaps that will pull out with a bit of force) be careful not to pull and damage the cables that route through the computer. This whole process requires you put the whole front panel on top of the case if you want to remove/add fans. Its a bit awkward.

Design function
-like most case manufacturers, the included case fans are not amazing. There are also only 2 included. You can't blame them for the price, but this case is marketed as ""unrestricted airflow"", which you can only achieve if you buy more fans. Make sure you consider this in your budget.

Design Aesthetic
-I really like how they look, so nothing here.
Overall Review: This is a great case with WAY more ""Pros"" than ""Cons"". When you take the price into account, any negatives are easy to live with. Considering the amount of style options you get from the product line, and all the little things like the power supply and SSD mount, its easy to recommend this case for anyone looking to make a great looking and functioning computer.",0.0,28.0,29.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Lightweight
Excellent airflow (for most builds)
Cons: Somewhat flimsy metal, bends easily
Almost too small to be considered an ATX case, working room is tight inside
PSU compartment would be too small for larger power supplies if using the HDD cage
Overall Review: Having used Fractal cases in previous builds, I bought this case based on the quality experienced in the past, as well as the potential airlfow. I was surprised at how small this case was. The pics do not give you a good perspective on the size, it is definitely a ""compact"" ATX case. Also surprising is the somewhat flimsy metal used in this case. It bends very easily but seems to hold it's shape for the most part. I mucked up one of the front fan mounts and could not get it re-formed completely.

The biggest problem I had was with the lack of working room inside the case. A full size ATX board almost completely fills the tray. Once I mounted my H105 240mm water cooler up top, there was very little room to install the pump over the cpu. Also, connecting the pump to the cpu fan header (located top right corner on an ASRock Z370 Pro4) was next to impossible as the radiator and fans covered the top 1 inch of the board.

Front panel holds 3 120mm fans, or 2 140mm. I installed 3 120s. To get the bottom fan in, I had to push the HDD cage back towards the power supply. This greatly reduced the amount space left for stuffing cables. A large PSU would not work with my setup. Luckily I picked a standard 140mm unit (Seasonic Focus Plus), but still had to bend cables connected to PSU at odd angles. The only good thing here is extra room behind the motherboard tray. Any extra cable slack got stuffed or tied up above the PSU/HDD bay.

My choice of video cards changed daily, according to prices, and I ended up with and EVGA GTX 1080 ti FTW3. Truly, this thing is massive. I've never worked with a card this big, it's just shy of 12 inches long. With the front fans mounted, I had just about an inch between the back of the card and a fan housing. It works, but It consumes that last bit of space you had for connecting cables, pins, etc. I had to remove the card twice, once to connect front header pins, next to install nvme ssd drive.

Overall, this is a very nice case but not the best choice for my build. Does it look good? Absolutely! Is the ariflow good? It's great! All my temps are good, no problems that I can tell at the moment. It's only a few hours old, we'll know more after testing. For a smaller build with a smaller GPU and no 3.5 HDD, this would work great. However, I dread ever having a component problem because I'll have to completely disassemble the thing.

- The pull out rack for SSD installs makes it easy to expand storage, plus if you ever decide to change cooling options on the CPU you can do that with the exposed backside of the motherboard.
- Enough space for clean cable management.
- High airflow keeps my components supercool without a need for watercooling.
Cons: - Pulling out the mesh front to install fans required watching Dmitri on hardware canucks to figure out how to do it without taking the whole front panel off. But I still needed to take the front panel off to get two 140mm fans inside as the left side of the black plastic panel obstructed the screw holes.
- The lower psu shroud area can get cramped with the 3.5 drive cage in the way.
- Black tint is really dark but I'm growing to love the void of darkness.
- Wish there was a fan hub like in the Define R6.
- No USB C option, would have been nice.
Overall Review: Case is only a little bit smaller than the original Meshify C by a few mm, which has the same limits for top radiator/front radiator cooling options, but oddly seems small in person when compared to Fractal's Define R6. Thermally this is so much better than the Enthoo Evolv mATX Tempered Glass case my system used to be in (gpu now at mid 60's vs mid 70's)",0.0,11.0,11.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

radiator support
tons of airflow
filtration
Looks great from the side
Plenty of tie down points
Cons: The top panel IO board is complete garbage and would be out of place on a $30 case let alone one this expensive. My first issue was with the front audio port, on my first time using it simply did not work. After some troubleshooting it was determined that it was the board on the case and nothing do do with the rest of the build. I contacted Fractal and they sent out a new one. It was a PITA to remove and install the new one as the board is very cheap and every edge is sharp. Fast forward a bit and I need to plug in a USB dongle for an XBOX controller, since my USB port on my keyboard was occupied I thought id plug it into the front USB on the case. The port wouldn't recognize the device and would not release it. I pretty much had to pry it out causing the dongle to break. So now i'm out an expensive dongle and would need to replace the front panel again if I intended on keeping the case.
Overall Review: I really enjoyed building in this case, there are plenty of small holes cut in logical places for USB headers, audio, and front panel wires. The rubber grommets are nice and work well for PSU cables and the like. There are plenty of fan mounts and GPU and radiator support is good for a case of this size. Plenty of tie down points in back for cable management.

The dark glass looks really well and seems to help my RGB from overpowering everything else.

Obviously the airflow on the case is really good and the filtration keeps the components on the inside clean.

Removing the front filter is awful and feels like you could easily break the whole front.

I really want to love this case, but the issues I have had with it will keep me from from Fractal in the future. The front of the case just looks and feels out of place and the issues with QC on the panel seem to back that up. I will be looking to NZXT or an o11 dynamic for future builds.

If the front wasn't junk this would be a 4-5 egg case.",1.0,7.0,7.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

I owned an older Arc Mini from Fractal that I stepped up from, and while it's not an astounding leap, the quality of life improvements, as well as the addition of new, mainstream PSU/HDD shrouds and tempered glass turned my PC into something totally new - a tasteful and quietly pleasing addition to my home.

In this price bracket, I can't find anything else I would choose over this case. And this is after spending hours searching, reading, and watching.

Bottom dust filter is amazingly easy to remove, clean, and insert.

Magnetic top filter is also very nice.

Channeled guides for all chassis fan mounts are so much nicer than single holes.

Highly expandable! With removal of bottom plate from basement floor for large radiators, or other installations of hardware in the basement portion forward of the PSU. For instance, I believe it would not be hard to mount an HDD to the floor of the chassis without the cage installed.

The best cable management I have ever worked with in a case. The rubber grommets, and shroud cut outs for cable runs are fantastic coupled with the tons of space they managed to get on the backside of the case.

Lightweight!
Cons: The HDD mounting is very poorly designed. It is awesome that it is removable, but it is not perforated/ventilated. This is a strange decision since it sits on a vented floor of the chassis.

The front mesh panel is very easy to bend/press. Be cautious.

Front panel frame is not removable once hardware is installed, it is tethered to the case due to the strange decision to attach the cables to the front panel. I considered very carefully whether or not to rate the case down for this feature, but it's not THAT much of an inconvenience since the front mesh so easily pops off.
Overall Review: Watch for space on that GPU measurement if you are planning on mounting a radiator in front. And even then, push/pull will likely not happen without some VERY careful planning on hardware.

In general, I would say this case is hardware limiting in some regards. Specifically in HDD expansion, GPU allowance, and PSU allowance in the presence of HDDs.

Further, I'd recommend anyone looking to buy a new case to spend some time watching videos on any case they are planning on. There is just no way to communicate the strengths of engineering that goes into a purchase decision without spending that time to research.",0.0,6.0,6.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I would definitely recommend this for anyone starting out with a budget and wants the subtle design with premium finishes; i.e. Tempered Glass panel and psu shroud. Great deal right now at $80. I love the angular design on the front panel. The space in this case is insane as I could even fit a 240 or even a 360 radiator either on top or in the front. I love how much air flows through, temps are down since I've used this case. Both of my SSDs are m.2 so I don't have to worry about the extra cables but the ssd drives are in the back behind the motherboard so they wont look awkward in your case. The only thing I wish it had was a vertical gpu bracket/mount but I can live without it, it'd just be nice if I ever wanted to get creative with it. Overall I love the case design, its features, and how much I can fit inside the tower (using the Fractal Design Celsius s24 radiator on the top and 2 more fans on the front panel.

Overall Review: Recently migrated an old build from a Thermaltake Commander to this case and have to say wow. Improved airflow has brought thermals down considerably. Only real gripe I have is the fact the front panel connectors are mounted to the front panel so you either have to do a fair amount of disassembly when installing fans or work around it which can be a pain. I'd also like to mention I managed to get a little more air from the front than it's spec'd for. By spec you can either run 3x120's or 2x140's I managed to run 2x120's as well as a single 140 between them.

Cons: The power supply shroud can make it difficult to get the 3.5"" 'caddy' in after the fact. This could be avoided if the whole front of it came off rather than just a small opening on the top. You need to decide if you're going to use 3.5"" drives ahead of time. I strongly suggest using a fully modular power supply with this case just to make your life easier.
Overall Review: Taking the front panel off can feel a bit janky, especially the first time. You'll feel like you're about to break it; but you're not.",0.0,4.0,4.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

The front panel mesh pops out if you take out the bottom dust filter and you can pop it out from the inside on the bottom. NICE DARK tint on the glass, makes the RGB look a bit muted which is nice.

Overall Review: Eggcelent (sorry) case for any DIYer, nice midsize form factor. Side note, i didn't know there were TWO versions of the tempered glass.

Overall Review: I love the way this case looks and I don't regret this purchase at all. I think this case it perfect for anyone using air cooling and wanting to maximize the cooling capability of your fans. I don't think things are too loud given the front panel. But it truly depends on the fans you choose. My current system is set up with 2 140mm Deepcool RF 140 fans at the front, the Cryorig H7 CPU Cooler, and the case fans Fractal included with the case at the rear for exhaust.
I would recommend going with 2 140mm fans at the front over 3 120 fans simply because 140s are typically quieter, and you won't need to remove part of the shroud and move the drive cage.

Normally my build excitement wavers when I start fighting with the case. Not this time!

I spent so much time planning it out from fans, to cable management, and looking up options to add for the near future. Hours later I just had to stop playing with it and start building.

Fans were an easy decision, add an additional one intake in the front and 2 on top. The cable channel, to a of tie off points, and the strategic access holes (save one) were awesome. I easily separated the power and data cables and organized easily.

*The motherboard dropped into perfect position over the standoffs!* I think the one plastic standoff middle on the ide port side helped a lot. No more micro adjustments while mounting this time.

Everything else went in great!
Cons: One issue I had that is design related. The first USB 3 header was lined up to a very convenient access port. However, connecting it without connector strain and possible damage was nearly impossible so I switched to the second header that was vertical. It was a very minor sacrifice of aesthetics for cable management. 'meh' Minor inconvenience not worthy of a star loss.

The cable management options are phenomenal. I didn't have to ""manage"" a single cable on the component side of machine. Everything naturally became hidden away.

I was coming from an ancient Antec 900 that sounded like a jet taking off, but I didn't need all of that. I stuck with the stock fans in this one and they are running whisper quiet.

Amazing case, definitely buy it!

Beware...you might be like me and get taken in by the appearance, so much so that you forget that you can't put a disc drive on the front. These days it doesn't really matter of course.

Remove the bottom filter, and then press the lip on the bottom of the front filter. It pops right out and gives you access to your front fans without dealing with the tethered front panel.
+ Aesthetics and build quality. Looks great and the whole thing is solid.
+ Cable management. Recessed area with Velcro, tie-downs everywhere, cutouts where there should be cutouts, and grommets.
+ Wide enough for tall CPU coolers.
+ Surprisingly quiet. Your fans can run slower when they aren't choked off by silly front panels.
+ The 2 120mm fans included are very good. I also use 2 140mm fans of the same type.
Cons: - I'd rather have an acrylic side panel with typical thumbscrews. Acrylic is lighter, easier to mount, has a smaller window area so you can hide cables on the edges easier, and I wouldn't worry about it ever shattering. Also, because of the way the glass mounts, hiding RGB LEDs along the side can get...tricky. You'll probably have part of the strip poking out. There's also not enough space in between the PSU shroud and the glass at the very bottom to run LEDs down there, but not a big deal.
- Not for people running custom water loops, most likely. Your AIO options are limited at the top and will limit your GPU length at the front. I don't use water cooling, but I just thought I'd add it.
Overall Review: I was comparing this case with Fractal's Focus G series. I couldn't decide whether I wanted a CD/DVD drive or not. I decided to just leave a free SATA data and power cable sitting loose behind the metal side panel in case I ever need to use it. I also preferred the acrylic window on that case. However, the Meshify C has better quality and easier to remove dust filters, more hard drive mounting options, and better cable management, so I chose it. If you're looking for a compact ATX tower with superb airflow, get the Meshify C.",0.0,3.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Tinted is like a Stripper Tease ... like ""what are you hiding in there"" ;) Turn the lights on (you will want some) and its ""DAMIN GIRL""
* Performance: My Powercolor R9 380X used to be audible when playing games ... but now I barely hear it ... in an ""OPEN CASE"" now on my desk vs floor. I have a Corsair h115i up front and there is a 140mm fan literally an inch away from the GPU. One of the 2 GPU fans doesnt even spin during 2D
* Performance 2.0: I ran both factory fans up front for a few days and was impressed with their performance. These are not throw-away fans. My initial plan was to run 3 120mm up front
* Case as a whole is on par or a tick above my experience vs Silverstone cases (MILO3)
Cons: * REALLY REALLY REALLY wish the top panel could handle a 280 AIO - more a wishlist item than con
* Top mesh filter is ""meh"" but really due to the ""magnetic"" aspect raises it ... ie just feels cheap and flimsy but should not affect performance
* Some say you dont NEED a modular power supply but the Power supply/hdd canopy is still cramped with my modular Antec
* MOBO power may be difficult to ""bend"" at 90% with an ATX MOBO. IE. my power cord has to enter ""below"" the port . I couldnt get my power cord to bend that much but this will vary by MOBO and Powersupply
* The front mesh design isnt really that noticeable in normal lighting
Overall Review: * Kinda miss having a top hdd/sata dock from my CM 690 II
* Dont miss the 5.25 bay and I like how it ( and moving the hdds) has shrunk cases these days
* Feel like they missed opportunities to mount sdd/2.5 on the exterior of the PS/HDD canopy .. then again .. Fractal Design is more a ""subtle"" then ""flashy"" as a company (ie tinted vs clear glass)
* VERY INTERESTED in future Meshify designs. It appears they really hit this design out of the park and hope they expand the lineup.",0.0,3.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Ample mounting for SSDs and HDDs unless you're building a NAS or something.
- I didn't buy it for the tempered glass, but the tempered glass makes it look stylish. Easy enough to get into the case, but almost impossible to put the screws back in without smudging the area around the screws.
Cons: - The Front panel looks ""crumpled."" I get it that it's supposed to be that way, but it looks more ""damaged"" than ""artistic.""
- The lip on the connector side of the motherboard tray is tight with a full sized ATX motherboard. You have to bend cables at some unnatural angles to get it to fit right.
- Included fans are 3 pin instead of 4 pin PWM fans.
Overall Review: To give some perspective, I've used the NXZT S340 and the Phanteks P400 prior to this. This case is better than those. This case has a similar layout to those cases, but is about 85-90% of the size of those cases. Probably about the same size as the Corsair 250D mATX case.

Small form but still able to fit everything
Airflow, airflow, airflow
Cons: Doesn’t support bigger GPU’s that well
Supplied fans are trash
Overall Review: Used this for my first custom build and it was easy to build in. Cable management wasn’t necessarily a breeze but that could just be my inexperience showing. The biggest issue was not being able to mount my aio radiator in the front due to using a 5700 XT red devil which was disappointing as I only needed an extra inch or two. Still, by using the front fans as intake, it helps cool the GPU some. Of course, the highlight of this case is the excellent airflow and gorgeous front panel. It’s also an excellent price so I’d totally recommend.

Also, unless you remove the shroud and hard drive bay, I don’t see any reason to put a third fan on the bottom. Unless you’re trying to get the “triple fan” glow through the front of the case, the third fan is only cooling wires and the PSU (which already has a good fan). This isn’t really a con against the case but it’s just a weird design feature.",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Case fan mounts provide optimal airflow.
Case is easy to build in.


Don't be afraid to push on the mesh on the front to remove it. I somehow took the whole plastic front off before being able to remove just the mesh. It's really in there good unless you know exactly where to push to release it from the housing.
Cons: Smaller than I expected, but all of my previous cases have drive bays on the front so that's the main difference. It's not a big con, per se. Just be aware that it may be smaller than you think.

Hard drive cage should be easier to remove. If the opening on the PSU shroud was a hair wider you could just pull the drive cage out through the back of the case. The way it's designed it only comes up and out through the inside and you can't have fans mounted as I learned the hard way. That opening is barely big enough for the drive cage.
Overall Review: Thoroughly enjoyed building in this case. There are plenty of cable routing options and places to put zip-ties and other cable management solutions. The grommets really help hide cables on the backside of the case and keep the motherboard looking clean for airflow and that big tempered glass window. I really like the look of the mesh on the front too as opposed to other options that are pretty plain.

As this is the first case I've built in brand new, I was really happy with everything that was included. Excellent case overall and I'd definitely recommend it for people wanting to build a mid tower.",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Lots of ability to add fans.
- Easy to install and remove TG panel.
- Neat front panel.
- Lower dust filter is removed from the front.
- Ease of cleaning all filters.
Cons: - Not a lot of space in the PSU shroud if you leave the 3.5"" drive bays installed. Also in default setup the drive bay blocks the lowest fan slot, but is easy to move.
- Front panel audio jacks are okay at best. I'd definitely plug into the mobo for best quality.
- only 2 included case fans.
Overall Review: This is my fifth full computer build, and my first time using this case. My specific build this time around has run into a lot of issues and I've needed to RMA a large number of my parts, including a motherboard, so technically I've built in this case twice now.

I can't say enough good about it. It's a wonderful case to build in. The footprint is a little smaller on the desk and I really enjoy the looks of it. I've added 4 RGB fans and moved the 2 included case fans to the top as exhaust. Under gaming load my temps hardly ever reach 70°C (both GPU/CPU using stock ryzen 3700x cooler) and a lot of that is probably due to the excellent air flow capability this case has.

Highly recommended, but do consider adding extra fans to make full use of this case.",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

The motherboard standoffs come with a tool to screw them in, a blessing for those who have built before. The screws are organized and the manual is comprehensive and details everything beautifully. The build quality like I've mentioned in the pros section is the best I've seen in this price range. There are dust filters everywhere and virtually anything can be customized to your liking.

(Same with PSU rear panel)
-Beautiful front panel design
-Provided fans move a decent amount of air and are definitely quiet
-Intake filter is nice
-Plenty of case screws provided
-Lightweight but sturdy
-Front Panel IO buttons feel good
-Bottom dust filter slides in and out smoothly every time
-Plenty of cable management tie down spots with provided velcro straps.
-Instructions were clear and the provided manual had all information I needed for a quick and easy build.
Cons: All cons are honestly nit-picky and really are not huge issues and should in no way convince you to buy any other case over this one.
-Top dust filter is rather useless if you are exhausting air like you probably would be
-PSU slot doesn't hold the PSU up completely so it can be difficult to get it threaded in. Additional standoffs at the bottom of the case would help alleviate this issue.
-This is truly a Compact mid tower so using a regular power supply cables leaves you with A LOT of cable to manage. Buying custom length cables would alleviate this issue.
-Using regular length cables makes using a standard size PSU as well as the HDD Cage almost impossible. some cable management and extra cable routing helps and you can mount a HDD to the bottom of the case if you want so the cage is not necessary.
-The removable cover provided on the PSU shroud has to be removed to add a third fan to the front of the case. I wish they had provided an optional replacement panel that would allow for the additional fan as well as a clean look.
-Based on previous reviews it looks like Fractal has gone to providing 8 MB standoffs with a pre-installed 9th in the middle. This helps for easy alignment with your IO shield BUT if your mother board uses that middle standoff slot for M.2 installation then you will have to remove the center standoff as it is not a regular standoff (The standoff is male to male with a threaded portion on the top).
The top and bottom cutouts for motherboard wiring could use some rubber grommets for a cleaner look.
-absolutely last and smallest complaint: the front fans are offset to the left so if you use RGB do not expect them to line up completely in the center of the case.
Overall Review: Next time I think I would order some custom cables so the cable management was a bit cleaner but overall it was an easy computer to build in that provided plenty of room for all components even a larger air cooler (used a be quiet! Dark Rock Pro). Also had no issue fitting quiet a long card (EVGA 2070 Super XC Gaming).

Unless you are doing a complex Water Cooling system,(which would be difficult in this case) air flow for your case is king. This case give you that air flow in spades. Overall its a good case to build in but you do need to remember that it is smaller than a full tower so if you have big hands take into consideration your timing of install for components. Especially around the top of the case. I really like the size of the case as its not too small and is way easier to place on or around the desk. The included 2 case fans are actually very quiet and seem to move a decent amount of air. I really like the fractal design on the front plate it is aluminum not plastic and really adds some character to the case. Overall Im pleased with this case and you mainly are getting this case for the great air flow in a relatively small package.
Cons: Cons: I feel the metal definitely has a bit too much flex to it, but its not too bad once fully built and buttoned up. The glass thumbs screws need to be replaced with a tool less option, its way to easy to make the small drop when taking the panel off and risk shattering it. The front plate is customization from fractal but then your magnetic dust filters don't match. They should offer them or choose-able when ordering as a package. People love differentiating their cases, not sure why manufactures don't make that more accessible to the average consumer. Same tool less access for back panel. The PSU dust filter should be accessible from the front. The top case power/USB/audio connections should be separated front the front panel, as is it will be a potential point of failure in the future. The feet are cheap plastic and 2 of mine came chipped, but wasn't bad enough that i cared.
Overall Review: Case could benefit from a third fan, but understand not everyone will need one and it keeps the cost down. I feel I listed allot of cons here, but most of these are pretty small issues that I would hope fractal could make improvements on, but none of them are show stoppers by any means. In fact I highly recommend this case for build in 2020.

Cable management is superb!
Easy removable dust covers!
Quality components
Attention to detail!
Fits the monstrous Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo with ease!
Cons: I cant think of any.
Overall Review: I have been building computers since Windows 98 (dude I am old). This build was the most enjoyable of any! I dont even really do cable management cause I hate the idea of strapping it all up and then getting irritated having to take it all apart to upgrade or fix something. This case made cable management fun to do...also very easy to undo!

The attention to detail is so nice with this case from the power supply sitting on rubber grommets to captive case screws to even the little motherboard standoff phillips cap so you can use a screw driver to put them on. It comes with little zip ties, but the main harness is velcro straps which I LOVE!

This is the second Fractal Designs case I have purchased. Both are fantastic! I love the power supply compartment to contain and dissipate the heat that it generates without contributing to the heat of the other components. Even the rear case fan is set to line up perfectly with the CPU Heatsink/Fan so CPU heat gets fast tracked exhausted right out of the case!

It has a version without a translucent side panel which is hard to find at this price point. It is very easy to remove and clean the fan filters.
Cons: The included fans are underwhelming. If you are spending this much on a case then you will probably be putting in pwm capable fans. This is my only gripe with the case.

- Love the shell to hide the power supply and hard drives.
- Steel.
- Great accessable areas around the motherboard for easy access.
- Mesh design to catch dust.
- Side panel for see through show...(to be continued...)
Cons: - Lets start off with a huge upset...This side panel doesn't quite reach all around the side of the case so there are a few gaps but that's the least of my issues considering I took the panel off and the side glass shattered in my hands busting everywhere on my desk I was shocked to say the least, as I have been building computers for 10 years and never had this issue with tempered glass I have contacted fractal, upon my request a decided to send me another side panel and insisted that this doesn't happen often, buyers beware.
-bottom mesh is hard to pull in and out.
Overall Review: This case is phenomenal for the price I couldn't imagine all the amenities I got within a lighted is all the dust filters that access the cabled management this is truly one of the bus cases of ever used for the price with the side panel shattering it had me alarmed at the quality though as for now I'll wait for my new panel in hopes that it was just are rare occasion.

This panel still gets five stars my only issue with that is the side panel not enough to get rid of one star , Highly recommend this case but please be aware at the side panel quality.",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Well designed: Front mesh can actually be removed without removing the whole front panel

Cons: - Smaller than I expected. It does fit an ATX board but BARELY. My GPU definitely did not fit with an AIO in the front .The top only has enough space for a 240mm and the AIO I have is 280mm. You must pick your parts carefully with this case. All the dimensions are included in the specifications of the product. You just have to do the maths.

sure there's no 5.25 drives, but almost everything is downloadable or streamable, so not an issue to me.

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Christopher R.,Ownership: 1 day to 1 week,Verified Owner,4/28/18 13:56,5.0,"Pros: • Sturdy
• Excellent Cable Management
• Practical placement and removal of dust filters.
• Versatility of component removal/repositioning

First thing that I thought once I pulled this out of the box is that you could tell from the weight it was a decent case. It is not to heavy for the size but enough to know that it is not the flimsy budget sheet-metal cases we have all used at one time or another to save a buck.

The case itself looks absolutely stunning. The front mesh is one of those deals where you will either love it or hate it. I personally love it. Yes there are no pulsating fans or LED strips but I would never expect that from swiss designers. This is the case you get when you want quality, some interesting minimalist design anesthetics and the ability for it to still be acceptable to be used in a professional atmosphere. I could easily see this case being used in a high end design studio or a post production facility.

The real beauty is when you take off the back panel. Plenty of room to run all your power cabling, you can adjust or even remove the drive cage if you wish to use that space for a large radiator or just to have more open space. Behind the motherboard you have a removable bracket that can mount 3 standard SSD drives. Velcro cable ties already included that run up the side of the case as well as some massive grommets and openings to get your cables to the motherboard. the PSU shroud also has some small (but large enough) openings for all your front panel connectors to keep the look tidy and clean.

The psu dust filter runs along the entire length of the case and is removable from the front. This is just one of those things I wish everybody did. there is also a release for the front mesh once you remove that filter that is convenient for cleaning and installing the front fans/radiator.

One thing to note is if you wish to use 3 120mm fans in the front of the case you will have to remove a panel on the shroud to accommodate this. Alternatively this also gives you space for any water cooling craziness you may concoct. This is not needed if you go the 2 140mm route but is worth noting. I have the slot and drive caged removed and I still find it aesthetic pleasing.

This case is perfect for me but might not be for somebody looking to load it up with drives. The included cage will only fit 2 3.5/2.5"" drives with the ability to also mount the aforementioned SSD's behind the motherboard. I am opting for a M.2 drive for my OS drive and plan on getting a NAS solution for my archive files in cool/cold storage. With a minimalist cable-wise setup like that I wanted a minimalist case to go along with it.
Cons: Not a con for me but some people might not like that it does not come with a fan or led controller. I do not see that as an issue as most manufacturers have gone pin header crazy in the last few years (not a bad thing!) If that is your bag you could pick up a SATA powered third party one and still be a fraction of the price of other comparable cases.

You have to buy other fans if you want it to look like a disco blew up.

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Anonymous,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,4/8/18 22:36,5.0,"Pros: I've done two builds with this case now. One was an i7-8700k high end PC, and the other an Ryzen 5 1600x mid tier PC. Both were an absolute blast to build.

The case itself is top notch build quality. I have zero complaints about it. I really like the mounting bracket for the 3x2.5"" drives. It's super easy to take off, mount the SSD's and then mount the bracket back onto the case. Cable management is superb.

Aesthetically, the case looks really good with a tinted tempered glass side panel. It helps drown out all the pieces that are not RGB lit, which I really like, although not everybody may be fond of that.

My high end PC build used an corsair h100i v2 240mm AOI which I placed on the top panel. One thing to keep in mind is that the combination of thickness from the radiator and the fans will make it brush up against high profile ram, so either mount it to the front panel, or use low profile ram, or thinner fans. I will be moving my AIO to the front panel once I get my new set of rgb fans.

The mid tier pc used an evo 212 air cooler which fit with no clearance problems at all so if you're worried about bulky air coolers not clearing height, don't be.
Cons: This isn't really a con, but if you are going to use the hard-drive bay for 2x3.5"" drives then make sure your power supply isn't super long or else you might have a tight squeeze on your cables as they come out of the power supply. This will also mean you will not be able to install a third 120mm fan at the very bottom of the front panel. It was ok in my case though as I was still able to place two 120mm RGB fans at the front for intake.
Overall Review: Next build will be a budget PC for my gf and it will either go in another Meshify C, or the Meshify C Mini (which I haven't tried yet).",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Solid cable management considering how small the case is. In fact, because the smaller design of the case naturally leads to more optimized cable management. You won't be able to get away with leaving cables everywhere like you would in a larger, roomier case.
- Quiet. Although the case has a lot of mesh, I can barely hear the fans, even if I listen very closely.
- Great airflow.
- I really like the look of this case, but obviously your mileage may vary.
Cons: - A little tricky to install everything given how small and compact the case is. I'll expand on this later.
- Although cable management is solid, it's still a little tight. There's space for everything, but you will need to work a little more than usual to get it sorted out.
Overall Review: This case is small and compact. Pay close attention to the specs to make sure your setup can fit. In particular, make sure your PSU, graphics card, and CPU fan can fit. Also, there aren't any front-end bays (e.g. for optical drives). This isn't a problem for me, but it could blindside someone who doesn't notice that there aren't any front-facing bays listed in the specs.

A few tips from my experience:
- There are two places that you can mount 2.5 inch drives, in the standard 3.5-inch drive bay (2 slots) or flat against the motherboard backplate in the cable management area (3 slots). For the slots against the motherboard backplate, right-angle cables will either be a tight fit or impossible, depending on which slot you use. I was able to fit a right-angled power cable to the middle slot on the backplate (and I think the slot towards the back of the case would allow for one too), but it barely fits. You might be more comfortable with straight cables. Also, due to this configuration, you might need more SATA power cables than you'd need for a case that featured all the drive bays stacked together.
- The PSU is stored in its own separate bay (you slide it in from the back of the case). If you have a modular power supply, it's difficult to plug in cables to the PSU once it's already installed because there isn't much space for your hand to fit. I recommend planning ahead and plugging in the cables that you'll need before you install the PSU.
- The case allows for 3 120-mm fans mounted on the front, but you won't be able to fit the third (on the bottom) without moving the 3.5-inch drive bay back towards the power supply, which may crowd the cables of your power supply.",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: no cons with the case it self! just somethings i found with my vary particular setup that i feel might be helpful to someone else.
if you use a 240 rad with 4 fans(a rad sandwitch) be aware that if you have a long gpu it may have length issues. i have a xfx 580 and i had to shave off about 2mm of the plastic fan shroud on the gpu to make it fit. the case is on the smaller size of mids so that was my only hickup and had nothing to do with the case it self just my need to have a over the top cooling setup with a longish gpu. but hey under full load im only hitting max 56c with over clocked ryzen 3 full OC so id say it worked out good ;)

-Dust filtering all around.
-Proper cut outs in the shroud at the bottom for hd audio and other wires.
-Recessed cable management area on the back -- this is a big one. Doing this means that even with things like sata power cables you have room. Most cases fail miserably on this one, but not the meshify!
-The recessed area goes all the way down to the shroud. This means that you don't end up with really tight choke points of cables. Nearly every other case I've used ends up with choke points and especially so around drive cages, but not with this one.
-There's room above the motherboard in the case. This is useful as it lets you avoid scenarios where you're trying to plug in a cpu connector at the edge of a board, and struggle due to the top of the case or a shroud being in the way.
-The front dust filter is easy to remove. It isn't hidden behind a front plate with silly brittle plastic pegs like everyone else currently does.
-It's not gigantic. It is refreshing to have a properly designed and sized case for basic air cooling setups. This thing is basically perfect in that regard.
-It isn't lit up like a child's toy like all the silly ""gaming"" cases. If you prefer a more refined and less childish design, this is the case for you.
Cons: -The front dust filtering could do with improvement. Fractal nearly nailed this one, and I'm not sure why it's such a difficult concept for case makers anymore, but even still it's just an almost.
-motherboard standoffs are not preinstalled.
-No type-c port.
-There is still some plastic up front for the filter and such despite the rest of it being metal/glass. I really hate plastic bits on the front of cases.
Overall Review: These are more stylistic changes I'd make, and not really cons:

-The front dust filtering could do with improvement. Magnets are your friend! Push panels that pop out when you push on them are also fantastic. Slide out filters are probably my favorite when they slide out to the left or right instead of down to the bottom of the case. It doesn't need the angular design on it either. I like style in a case, but not when it comes to things that get in the way of cleaning or make things brittle. Function over form when making a case, always.

-I would very much like a non-tempered glass edition. Flatten out the front panel, get rid of the TG window. But keep the thumb screws on the side -- that's just how a panel should be anymore. No sliding in teeth, and it just works.

-As mentioned in cons, ditch the plastic. Add 50 bucks to the price if you need to. We will buy it. I would buy two. Especially with the aforementioned filter improvements.

-The velcro for cable management on the back is only in the recessed area. Putting these below the 2.5"" drive plate would have been a nice addition. Velcro on the other side for the CPU connector is a possibility too.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with this one. It's rare for me to say that about a case anymore. So many designers just don't seem to actually build computers in their own cases, and it *really* shows. Fractal thankfully sure seems to!",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Switched to this case from a Phanteks Enthoo Evolv mATX non TG and I am so happy I did and for one reason alone, AIRFLOW!!!! CPU temps dropped by and average of 10-12c. To be fair the Enthoo Avolv mATX is a very nice case but the temps I was getting were just rediculous in my opinion. Fortunately someone like Fractal Design decided to be ambitious and make a case with nice aesthetics and excellent airflow. Mesh is back baby
Cons: -When you pull off the front panel it is still thethered to the case, kind of annoying but nothing worth takin an egg off.
-Not a con for me but just to warn some, this glass panel is very dark, if you have no lighting you will see almost nothing inside, personally I like it but I know a lot of people do not.

Stock setup with 1 in the front and 1 in back will provide sufficient airflow so you don't really have to upgrade the fans. But I had these nice ML140 fans in a prior build so it's a welcome addiction giving great led look and airflow to the CPU cooler and GPU cooler.

The SSD panel on the back is one of the best features in the case. Makes cable management a breeze with them all lined up on the panel.

Something simple as having nice chrome finish case feet is a nice touch with solid construction.

All the dust filters are positioned well and can be taken off for easy cleaning.

I love the Dark Tint Temper glass and in my opinion looks awesome.

Great airflow.
Tempered glass is nice.
Excellent cable management system.
Smaller form factor due to the 5.25-less design (not all new cases take advantage of that).
Full length Power Supply dust filter accessible from the front.
Magnetic dust filter on top is good and seems to not restrict much airflow.
Included fans are sufficiently quiet.
Power Supply bracket.
Case feet are tall enough for good airflow to the Power Supply.
Captive thumb screws (they cant fall off) on the side panels.
Cons: The only real flaw is that with an AIO liquid cooler installed in the front of the case, it will not fit the longest of graphics cards
(Seems that the clearance is about 285mm just by checking with a ruler). That wont be an issue for everyone, but it should be kept in mind.
Overall Review: I would highly recommend this case to anyone who wants a smaller ATX case.
Glass side panel is tinted, and that is a ""love it or hate it thing"", I love it though.
Build quality is great, and it is mostly easy to use.
Large front filter is a little hard to get open (Although I don't really think there was any other way to design it to make is easier to get at without sacrificing looks).",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Dark Tempered Glass
-It is a Define C with, well, TG and better air flow.
-Air Flow is greatly improved (this was something the C got dinged for in the past)
-Ease of build--see cable management
-Flexibility
-Filters
-overall look
-
Cons: -Plastic shroud on the front feels a bit, meh; you know? I do not mean cheap, but I also do not mean that I always feel comfortable removing it. So, meh.
-front air filter is easy to remove if you know how; see HardwareCanucks review of the case for how to do so rather safely
-some will not like how dark the tempered glass is; I love it, though. The hardware shines through just fine for us.
-no lip/groove for the TG to rest on. You have to be careful when taking it on and off.
-other competitors have cases with TG on both sides for the same price; to be fair, though, those competitors likely do not have some of the same things that the Meshify C has. This, friends, is the nature of buying a computer case. It is a constant give and take.
Overall Review: I would recommend it. I have built/rebuilt two computers in the last two months using TG cases. And I enjoyed greatly working with the Meshify C. It is, at its most basic, a Define C with mesh on the front and glass on the side. But, if you were like me, and wished the Define C had, well, glass on the side and mesh on the front, you are in luck. Do yourself a favor and read up on the Define C first. Then watch reviews on the Meshify C.

I do hope in a future revision that Fractal puts some sort of lip on the case for the TG to rest in.",0.0,2.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Great air flow.
- I removed the optional 3.5"" Drive cage and that gave me some extra room for my PSU cables.
Cons: - The one drawback, which I'm docking half a star, is I wish they would have provided 9 standoffs instead of 8. The middle standoff already installed in the case is for lining up the motherboard. I have an MSI x570 motherboard and it came with a heatshield for one of the M2 drives. In order to install the heatshield, I had to order an additional standoff (a got a pack of 6-32). MSI included an adapter to screw into a standoff, but because the middle standoff (already installed in the case) is for alignment (you can't screw anything into it) I had to order the extra standoffs. This was not a dealbreaker in my eyes, just more of an annoyance. Maybe I missed something in all the little bags, but I did a double check and couldn't find an extra standoff.

There is a lot of room to work with if you are using a standard ATX board. I was hesitant on buying this because I am using a regular PSU with all the cables. However, there is still plenty of room to hide cables you are not using. I did not have any trouble closing the case or moving the spare cables out of the way. You can also rise and lower your fans by a few centimetres higher or lower.
Cons: The only con I can think of is the hard drive bay can be kind of tricky to get to if you already routed your wires. The bay does pop-out for installation too though, so it was not too bad. If you are going to use 3 120mm fans in the front, you will have to remove the HD shroud.

-Fan mounting is very easy. I have an Alphacool Eisbaer 240 in the top of the case with a push configuration (fans below the radiator), and everything fits just fine. If you need to reseat a DIMM, I used the reverse end of a pen to push on the DIMM lock.
-PowerColor Red Dragon 5700 fits perfectly inside.
-Airflow seems great, even with more sponge-style dust filter up front. Airflow is quiet, and even seems to dull the sound from my GPU fans, which can get loud.
Cons: -Front panel doesn't come in more colors like the mid-tower Meshify case does.
-Wish it came with a few more velcro cable ties.

Cons: Once the Motherboard is secured, the cutouts for the from I/O weren't large enough to pass through multiple cables to connect to your motherboards panel.

The PSU shroud should have slid under and back towards the PSU instead of coming off completely, but i understood why it had to. Would have been nice to have a half plate if your just doing a three fan config.

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,mark u.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,6/13/20 10:20,4.0,"Pros: Beautiful looking yet simple case, nice wide open and the front looks a lot nicer than I expected. This is my second build on a Fractal Design case - first one was the define and for the most part everything is identical fairly easy to route most cables behind the motherboard. I do not have a lot of cases to compare this one with so I can only say that over all for the price this is not a bad case.
1. Front usb are 3.0 and easy to access, but out of the way.
2. This case seems optimized for with a huge open front and top, you could create a ton of airflow which may be good for my build of a Ryzen 3900x on a MSI Carbon MOBO which is notorious for running hot
3. Like the Define C - the shroud for the HDD/powersupply/ leaves some extra room for stuffing unused cables... which you always have way too many from most power supplies lol.
4 Nice feature to be able to remove all of the dust screens from front/top/side for cleaning - should slow down the accumulation of dust in the inside. and with the glass cover you will be motivated to keep it on your desk to show off the RGB display and keep it clean. extra bonus, on you desk allows for much more airflow for basic cooling..
Cons: 1. There is not enough room between the pass through holes and the USB 3.0 Header and Sata connectors causing the connector to rest on the rubber grommet/metal. This may be different for motherboards that have vertical access to headers. for those that are horizontal on the edge of the board like my MSI boards (gaming and Carbon)
2. Glass side design is nice but poorly designed, the bevel edge does not match up to the metal edge leaving a small gap. Would be nice if it were as easy to get into as my first build on the Design C. Thumb screws holding the glass on are short so it is easy to screw them out and drop one.
3. if your looking for a whisper Quiet case this is not it - stock fans provided along with the Very cool Wraith cooler that comes with Ryzen CPU and lots of open sides will not dampen the noise you hear coming from inside. it will not muffle whatever you put in it that makes noise.
Overall Review: Overall, its a nice looking case and while I may not build another computer in this specific case or this line from Fractal, I will say you won't be disappointed by to many things in this case for basic builds compared to other cases in its class.
so if ever these Design cases were redesigned, make some of the holes for routing cables a little bit larger and move the main power/cable ports away from where mobo edge sits to allow for a little wiggle room.
I give it four stars as I figure that in its price class - it is probably one of the better cases you can get. It would fall to 3 or less if you were comparing it to top end case. This is a Honda Civic of cases, not a Lamborghini.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Style
Cons: I wish the screws that held on the glass window stayed attached even when unscrewed. I’m gonna lose one eventually I know it.

Wish the power and reset buttons had more movement to them. I think my cat could jump on the case and turn off my computer.
Overall Review: I strayed from my usual case brand and couldn’t be happier with the move. I’m not typically one to put in a ton of effort on really neat and proper builds, but this case made it sooo easy I couldn’t believe how nice the end result was. Spots in all the right places to run cables the way it just makes sense, resulting in a super clean and efficient build.

The resulting airflow in the case is top notch, especially with the “open” top, bottom, and front, coveted by mesh metal.

I usually don’t get cases with glass windows, but the dark tinted glass was the only one in stock at the time of my order. Ended up pretty happy with that too. It’s dark enough that you can only see in if you’re really looking, and only enough to see the 2070 SUPER LED. Dig it.

Cons: 280mm/360mm water cooling setups will limit storage options.
Overall Review: If you're thinking about using an AIO or some other water cooling setup, be aware that you will likely not be able to use 3.5"" hard drives. I used a Corsair H115i which is a 280mm aio and while it DOES fit, I had to place it in the front intake position (as that's the only location a 280 will fit) and that required removing the 3.5mm drive cage inside the ""basement"" area.

I had two SSDs and thankfully there is space for them behind the motherboard, but I would have been out of luck had I not had straight+straight sata cables (most mobos come with straight+right-angle).

-Looks even better in person
-Many well placed ports for cable management
-A small amount of modularity that works exceedingly well
-Included fans seem to be quite good, but I immediately installed other fans alongside them, so I cant testify to airflow with the stock ones alone.
-Comes with easily removable filters on top and bottom, and the front mesh works decently enough as a filter
-Comes with all screws needed for every port and option, even ones that are typically included with the components themselves
-Dark tempered glass allows a very clean, low-profile look when RGB is off or not present, but affords a very good look at components when lit.

Overall just a very nice case that
Cons: Not really a con, just a thing I did to make it better for my individual usage

-I made custom dust filters to fill the front and top grilles, as the front mesh (top was fine but I had extra material) is a little bit more open than I'd like for as dusty as my area is, although they ARE highly effective for pet hair.
Overall Review: I would absolutely recommend this case to anyone looking for a reasonably sized, adaptable, easy to set-up case.

Got the Gigabyte Aorus Elite X570 MB, Ryzen 7 3700x CPU, Sapphire Radeon Pulse 5700XT GPU, WD Black 500GB M.2 NVME, Seagate Firecuda 2 TB SSHD, TEAMGROUP Dark Za 32Gb 3200Mhz RAM, Thermaltake Toughpower Gold 750W modular PSU, and 5 Thermaltake RIING 12 Plus LED fans.
Cable management in this case is definitely a plus for me. Was able to get a really clean-looking build. Glass side panel is nice, clear, and sturdy. Case seems well built. I love that the expansion slot covers are screw in, and NOT breakaway. Case comes with 3 velcro cable straps along the side which really helped with my cable management. Even the openings for the cables have nice rubber protective grommets that help hide the insanity behind the motherboard! It has plenty of airflow, with the mesh front.
Front, bottom, and top all have nice removable dust filters.
It's a great looking case.
As for customer service, they are fantastic! First, my kid baked my top dust filter on top of the toaster oven (I left it there as I was working on the build), and I sent them an email and they promptly sent me a replacement at no charge!
Second, and my only actual issue, was the headphone jack on the front panel was defective. It only allowed mono signal, and when I wiggled the jack the computer would instantly reboot. No problem, emailed them and they sent me a replacement front header and everything is working perfectly now!
My only gripe design-wise is that you can't install 3 fans on the front and still hide the cables underneath because there is an access panel that does not allow clearance for the bottom fan. So only options are either install the 3rd fan and have the build look like bad with a big open space in the floor of the case, or just go with 2 fans and keep it looking neat and clean. Wish they had thought of this. Not a deal-breaker for me, though.

The tempered glass is gorgeous (and the thumbscrews _with_ rubber washers to avoid cracking the glass are thoughtful touches). The mesh components on the front and top are great for both looks and airflow too.

Speaking of airflow, the built-in fans are whisper quiet - in fact, even after adding PSU, GPU (with three fans of its own) and a mega-huge CPU cooler, the rig is whisper quiet in this case! Meshify doesn't have any sound dampening materials that I can tell but it's just so well made that everything seals up nicely and the case fans are large so they don't have to spin as fast to keep things cool. My components have performed well during gaming with barely any noise audible from the case.

It's been a LONG time since I built a PC and wow, in the past 8-10 years, cases have come a LONG way!!

Building my PC was SUPER easy with this case thanks to very clever cable routing and conduit for cables as well as having all cables, screws, standoffs, etc. in individual bags with clear labels in the case manual. It made everything very straight forward despite me being very rusty in terms of PC building.

One pleasant surprise for me was that there was only one cable to the motherboard for all the USB ports on the case. I'm used to multiple smaller cables connecting to individual headers on the motherboard but this was one-and-done! A benefit of both the case and the motherboard, I guess.
Cons: The only con I can think of is the section at the bottom that houses the PSU and optional SSDs or HDDs, can't be removed. I only used an nVme m.2 drive so I didn't need half of that space and I couldn't reclaim it by removing the ""cage"" at the bottom. Not a big deal though, but something to be aware of.

Oh and I guess if you want an optical drive (Blu-Ray burner, etc.) this case doesn't really support that to my knowledge. The mesh front seems to be one piece. These days the need for an optical drive is minimal or non-existent so it's not likely a big deal. I have a USB optical drive for my laptop and this case has plenty of convenient USB ports so I can work around this limitation. It may be a deal-breaker for some though so I thought I'd mention it.

- No USB C on front I/O.
Overall Review: I would recommend this case to anyone. I'm a fairly new PC builder myself and this case made it as convenient as possible while providing a lot of customization options in a fairly tight space. Great work fractal.

- Great airflow. I love the magnetic dust cover on the top of the case, and the removable one on the bottom.
- The white color is beautiful, and the mesh on the front of the case has a cool pattern to it.
- The tempered glass looks great, and is very easy to remove when you need to regain access to the components.
- Has great cable management, with velcro strips inside the back of the case.
- The branding is subtle.
Cons: - The box of screws and other things you'll need that come with the case are placed inside the HDD cage in the bottom portion of the case, and were a bit of a pain to get access to. I thought I was missing it at first, as it was hard to see it stuffed away in there.
- I wish the front mesh could be taken completely off. It pops off pretty easily but cannot be fully removed as it remains attached to the case via the cables for the USB ports/power button/etc.
- Included case fans are just ok. I'm planning on replacing them soon.

Cons: - It wasn't free.
- The power button could be light up, or made the button a triangle or just something ""cool"". It's just a recessed square on top.
- I had to wait for delivery because of COVID-19. That's literally all I can think of.
Overall Review: Replaced an old Antec case and the difference is literally night and day. This case wasn't even that much more expensive compared to the older case either, yet it comes with so many nice features.
- First off, the design/aesthetic looks great. I love the clean white and black design.
- Inside the case, I had no problems lining up holes or screws, everything just worked and was laid out step-by-step. I am a beginner when it comes to cases and I had no problems transitioning from the old case to the new one.
- The cable routing may be a feature of most cases, but my old case literally just had a hole in the back and you couldn't even route all the cables through it or the other side panel would not go back on. This case has so many little notches and is already designed in such a perfect way that the cables can be routed and tucked out of the way. It even comes with some fancy velcro ties which you can use to hold cables as well.
-The bottom enclosure hides all those really long cables that come out of the PSU that you have to ""stuff"" in the bottom. Having them enclosed makes everything look so neat!
- The little mounting spot for SSDs is located on the back of the motherboard area. This is genius if you ask me. It is a tight squeeze to get SATA cables connected, so check on your motherboard how long your SATA cables need to be. In my case, I had to travel to the lower right-hand corner which was a stretch but I was finally able to get it with 2 standard cables and I needed a slightly longer one to reach my 3rd SSD. If all else fails there are ""traditional"" HDD bays you can use where the travel length would be more standard.
- The front USB ports are USB 3! I didn't have the right connection on my motherboard at first but was easily able to rectify. There are internal adapter cables for USB 3 to USB 2 or if you have a blank PCI-e spot you can easily find expansions. Finding they were USB 3 was a nice surprise.
- The fans are whisper quiet and there's room for a ton more. I was able to reuse the fans from my old case in addition to improve airflow even more. Everything is whisper quiet and looks incredible thanks to the glass side. And I can actually enjoy the lights on my graphics card that I missed out on all these years because my old case was fully enclosed.
- Overall, I am so pleased with this case! Despite the crazy times we are experiencing right now with coronavirus, it was great to be able to work on a project and have everything go smoothly with a great product I will be able to look at and love and enjoy for years!",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: Just to specify, this is a review for the [Fractal Design Meshify C White - TG FD-CA-MESH-C-WT-TGC White Steel / Tempered Glass ATX Mid Tower High-Airflow Compact Clear Tempered Glass Computer Case]

My first thoughts were on the color of the case. its a very nice blend of Black with white accents from one angle, but a white with black accents from the other. (i went from a prebuilt asus tower before this so bare with here) My next thoughts were on the openness of the case on the inside. The drive sleds being moved down to the power supply cover is a great change, and in case of emergency this will make them very easy to change out. Just pop off the back and slide a drive out.

The main compartment of the case was able to fit a (full atx) Tuf Gaming x570 motherboard which i was worried about but had no problems. Was also able to fit a dual fan 1070 ti. I do think a larger GPU would have fitment issues as there is only 3 inches of space left from the GPU to the front of the case. I would recommend top mounting a radiator if your going for water cooling. There might be enough room up front but it would be close.

Cable management almost did itself with the case. Raised pass-through ports made getting the cables to the board a breeze. With the larger board there was a little finessing needed at some of the pass-throughs (because of the connector heads) But the ports are large enough to even fit the 24pin power connector. Even the front panel connectors were premanaged

All in all its a great case and a breeze to build in. If its your first build, do yourself a favor and get a nice case like this.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Everything makes sense to a guy who builds a pc every 2 years.

Spaces for additional fans well thought out.
Cons: Have to pull the PSU out a bit to attach cables. No biggie.
Overall Review: Excellent case. Wanted a smallerish case and this is perfect. Comes with 2 fans, added a couple of Noctua 140 mm fans to the front and moved the 120 to the back. Deep enough for tall cpu cooler and gpu. Airflow is excellent. Cleanable filters. Will most likely use this case again for the next grandkid.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- case is designed well for hiding cables, including some velcro wraps

- case is light, in comparison to my last rig
- handy instruction booklet if you're like me and need a build refresher.
Cons: - bit of a tight fit getting everything in there, but you only gotta build the thing once.
Overall Review: In this case, I did a full build. Full size graphics card, 2070 Super, 3700x with stock heatsink, 2 hard drives. 2 SATA ssd cards as storage in addition to the M.2 card of course. I guess I could always use more usb 3 ports, or usb-c ports on the front. But for my needs this case worked very well. Would recommend to anyone trying to do a more compact ATX build. I did find it a little strange that it was about an inch wider than my last case, but it's much shorter length wise.

Fits even a huge asus strix 2070 super no problem. If you have a gpu the size of a strix 2070super you can’t have more than a 120mm front mounted AIO rad tho
Cons: You have to remove a bottom plate to fit a third front mounted case fan, that means the cables you are hiding under there will be visible. I cut mine so it fits perfectly around the fan.

- Solid documentation

Overall Review: Matter of preference, but I like that this case bucks the lights-everywhere RGB trend - aesthetically the case reads as quality without being flashy or visually loud.

This was a first-time build (though I have prior experience replacing PC components) and I appreciated the thoughtful design of this case and the windowless side-panel option (my cablework is fine / out of the way but not necessarily pretty).",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Airflow seems good for its size, temps on a 9900k are idle at 30C with an NH-D15.
-Shroud over bottom half that covers power supply and excess cables, cleaner look.
-Tinted glass looks nice as it mutes the inside, but still gives a decent look at everything visible.
-Plenty of mounts for fans for even more cooling if needed.
Cons: Pretty minor cons, but might've turned me off when before hand if I had read up some more, still overall happy with product.
-SSD mounting is very close to side panel, not much clearance for cables in that regard.
-Clearance between larger CPU coolers is pretty close (NH-D15, for example, needs to have fans adjusted).
-Routing holes for things like motherboard power are kinda awkward to work with (might be fixed with easier to bend cables, can't really test this tho).
Overall Review: Pretty much everything is listed above. I might suggest you go with water cooling for both a better look and better compatibility with clearance, but the NH-D15 did fit so I can't complain. Would also recommend not using 3.5"" drives so you can remove the drive cage to assist with cable management.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

It doesn't have the compromise between features and looks that a lot of cases have either. It feels solid and looks great with an awesome set of features for cable management and drive mounting.
Cons: The bump where it goes from the motherboard tray to the dedicated cable management channel at the front interferes with EATX boards. This is the only compromise between aesthetics and compatibility. This case could easily support EATX boards if that bump was made to a right angle that started just past the edge of an EATX board with a new cutout for the 24pin cable.

I can't count this against the product though as it's not bad design as much as it is a conscious choice that was made in design.
Overall Review: As you may have guessed by the con, I had purchased this case with the intent to use with an EATX motherboard. It's easy enough to mod the case to fit the EATX board and get the 24 pin to the board. There's already a lot of missing material in that area and I only ended up cutting a couple square inches of metal out of the case without affecting the structural integrity of the motherboard tray.

Nice isolation of power supply from mainboard area. Nice isolation of 3.5” drives from mainboard area. Very light, yet precision fit case. I went with metal sides, no glass. The included case fan are smooth and silent. Room for two more fans above mainboard, additional front and rear fans -but for my system those were not required.
Overall Review: I was very pleased with the fit and finish of the case. The locations for mainboard standoffs were exactly matched to my ATX board. Power supply installation was easy and I like how the power supply is in a separate comparment from the mainboard so there is no interference with drives, cards, or cables.

Very easy to install mainboard, video card, RAM and route cables. Sides come on and off easily using captive thumb screws and no tools. Instructions show how to remove filter screens, front panel, etc.

Overall Review: After a good deal of research, this was the case I ended up buying for my first PC build. As soon as I opened the box and took the case out, I was impressed with what I saw. The modern design looks crisp, especially in white.

It's clear the designers behind this product we're concerned with function as much as form. Like others have said in their reviews, the airflow in this case is solid for a d landing build. Adding to that, the provided Velcro on the back side of the motherboard position makes cable management a cinch.

After putting it all together, the cables all ran on the side of the case with the solid panel. Even if someone doesn't care for cable management too much, you won't see any of it. The other side has a tempered glass window where you'll be able to clearly see the processor fan, graphics card, and any of the power cables for the motherboard and GPU. With even a small amount of effort, these cables can be run in a way to make everything look clean. The smaller cables going directly to the motherboard are hardly noticeable. If any of your components have RGB, this is where the tempered glass really makes the build look good. I'm sure it's a first-timer's thing, but I often catch myself glancing under my desk while browsing the web or during a loading screen/down time while playing a game to marvel at how good it looks.

Would recommend this case for anyone, especially first timers. May even get one of a different design for a future build.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

I absolutely love building his PC inside this case. It took me around an hour to do everything including the cable management. The fan in front of the GPU is helping a lot keeping his RX 580 at a decent temps under load. The fans included are quality fans and each should cost you around $10.

- Easy to build in
- Plenty of cable management areas
- Includes an intake and an exhaust fan pre-installed
Cons: - Does not include a fan controller or splitter cable. My motherboard only has one fan header, so I had to purchase the adapter separately.
- Top standoffs were difficult to install and require force
- Middle standoff does not have area for installing screw & was not explained in the owner's manual. I ended up removing it and putting a regular standoff instead.

Well thought out interior.

Overall Review: I was done putting my new PC together. I was closing up this case with the glass side panel. One corner slipped and bumped my granite desk. The entire glass side panel spider webbed.

Nice air filter on the bottom
Like the reset button on the front
Power button is nice and small, not something big and bulk that would fail after a year
Cons: SSD spot is VERY tight, had to bend cables to a degree that I am not comfortable with; just the power cables as I used straight SATA connectors. Bending the power cables which caused so much pressure on the drives makes the death scary clicking noise from the contacts on the drive as you move it back and forth, making it sound like an extremely loose contact, but all drives were detected and are working.

Overall Review: I highly recommend double checking your ram height if you are planning on installing a dual fan radiator on the top of the case. I personally went with the Corsair H100i Platinum (240mm rad) and it fit perfect with the Corsair vengeance ram. Another note I would add is the limited room for a larger power supply. I went with the Evga super nova 850w. With a third fan on the bottom of the front panel, the hard drive bay pushed up fairly close to the PSU forcing me to run a few cables through the top hard drive bay.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Cooling in this case was no problem. The two fans that come pre-installed in this case are fantastic and cool very nicely. I've added two !bequiet fans but might switch them out for the fans that are already in the case!
-Coming from no PC building experience and previously bought a prebuilt (bad idea), building in this case was simple and easy enough and made life easy.
-The case looks phenomenal, especially with the pattern in the front not being a flat mesh screen. The little designs on the mesh make it stand out and gives it a unique look and makes it stand out to all other cases. I also had gotten the white version of this case to match my white motherboard and RAM.
-Overall for the price point I would consider this a high end case and recommend to anyone looking for a case.

Great job Fractal Design!

-Excellent build quality
-Stellar airflow with very flexible fan and radiator support
-Form and function in equal measure. Very efficiently engineered and designed.
-Simple be effective cable management makes for a streamlined building process
-Dust filters are all easily accessible and of high quality
-Compact size means almost zero wasted space on the inside and gives it a small footprint on your desk.
-Case accessories came individually boxed, bagged, and labeled.
-REALLY high quality instruction manual.
Cons: -Check measurements for GPU if using a front mounted radiator, as this case isn't as long as most other mid-towers.
-PSU access hole for drive cage and 360mm radiator/bottom fan support could be improved by having cover plates of varying lengths to account for multiple use cases.
-This is purely subjective and cosmetic in nature, but I do wish the PCI-E slot area didn't have the dividers between the removable covers. If it didn't, you could just remove all of the covers for one large opening and you could install a modular vertical GPU bracket like what Cooler Master sells.
Overall Review: I am utterly in love with this case. It is an absolute dream to build in, with just the right balance of form and function. Airflow is amazing. Cable management is easy and simple with the included velcro straps, grommetted cutouts, and enlarged front channel area. Fan mounting points are plentiful, appropriately offset, and the dust filters are easily accessible. And while I love that this case isn't as long as most other mid-towers, be aware that the truncated length can limit the size of GPU you can use, especially if you're using a front-mounted radiator, so just check those measurements. If something doesn't fit, it's on you.

Overall, I think this is one of the best cases ever made for under $100 and I couldn't be happier with my decision to use it for my build.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

They include a rather basic guide manual for set up and all the accessories you will need. It's amazing how cheap it is given the quality. I boutght this to use with an 8700k with the Noctua H-15s and chromax covers - it just barely fits with about 5cm to spare! Cable management is perfection because they include a nice channel to run cables to and from the motherboard with branded straps. The dark glass is really a nice touch, it ends up highlighting your LED stuff over the raw components due to the darkness.

The cable management is great and it's so clean inside. It's my favorite build so far (I've done at least 10) I also never realized how much space the 5 1/2 inch drive bays take. The length of the case is a lot less and that makes it much easier to carry as I am a smaller person at 5'3. It also weighs less which is a plus. It does seem to be real quiet but I didn't have the front fan plugged in yet. It should be fine.
Cons: The front filter is a pain to get out. I haven't been able to yet but I'll figure it out. Maybe I should read the instructions :-\. I wish there was a lip for the glass to sit on so make sure you have the case pretty flat when removing or installing it. It will stick to the rubber gromits somewhat which helps but don't rely on that. It is tempered glass after all.
Overall Review: I can't wait to get my RGB kit to light this thing up. I got the tinted glass and it's pretty dark but I really like it. I would recommend it. Also for those that are annoyed that it doesn't have a place for a DVD drive just buy an external one. I got a BD-RW for $50 a few years ago.

Convenient cutout above the PCI-E slot covers makes fastening screws easier. Cable management is mostly a breeze due to the deep channel towards the front. The white and black aesthetic looks sharp.
Cons: The angled cutouts to the right of the motherboard are very close to the edge of the motherboard, and make it difficult to use the SATA ports on an Asrock B450M Pro4. While fans can be mounted to the front without removing the bezel, the left side of the bezel does get in the way - an extra 2mm of room would have been nice. The glass is just a flat panel mounted with four thumbscrews. There is no rest/lip to rest the glass on at the bottom of the case.

Lots of space, feels very premium. It was built with cable management in mind as they're velcrow straps at the back of the case, along with many tie down points and multiple rubber groumets for easy cable management.
Cons: - The only con I have about it is that it's hard to distinct the motherboard screws between the hard drive mount screws, I accidentally mounted the hard drive screws into my motherboard.

The flow design is real world cable management, all my cables are controlled easily thanks to the placement of the cable ducts/through ways. Plenty of tie down points for wire ties. The screw slots/slides are a great idea as I needed to move the Hdd block over a bit for a fan, and the top mounting slots made the radiator install easy. The rear side 2.5 mounts are also a plus, easy to get to. This is a Ryzen 2400g build btw.
Cons: None yet, don't see any in future with this
Overall Review: One note of caution for those buying larger power supplies....I have a 750 in it modular and I had to move the hdd block back over a bit to keep from really pressing in on the modular connectors, so any larger in length would make it really tight.

Cases have changed and from the looks of the case, for the better. Let's get to it:
- Design is clean simple, and pleasing to the eyes
- Airflow is more than ample. Between the Cryorig cooler and just the two fans in the case things are nice and cool
- Quiet. Good lord this is a quiet case. It sits less than 3 feet from me and I rarely hear it.
- Dark tempered glass side panel was just what I wanted. I know some wonderful people love to display the internals like a movie show, but I wanted something a bit more reserved and less in my face. This is it. It's dark enough to look classy in the day and at night is a nice warm light show.
- Did I mention the design? I did but here it is again.
- Cable management is a dream. No issues at all.
Cons: Listen, this case is great. Only a few things which could be slightly better.
- Front filter is a bit hard to get to. I'd suggest in the next design pass, make it a little easier.
- PSU filter is also a little hard to access. Not a deal killer in any sense, but it is was a bit more accessible this case would be like a cold beer on a hot day, breathtaking.

- Adjustable fan positions
- Perfect balance between light weight and build quality
Cons: Can only accomodate two 3.5"" drives. If you have a lot of HDDs, get the Define R6.
Overall Review: I built two systems in this case so far, and I will probably build several more. Even in 2018, this is still one of the best cases availaible, with an amazing price tag. I highly recommend this case. Check YouTube reviews if you want. They all praise this case.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1
Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Michael Z.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,3/9/18 11:19,5.0,"Pros: Very well crafted, absolutely no thin and cheap materials used anywhere. Layout was well thought out through and through. Room for an absolute plethora of fans, with filters everywhere. Case fans included might as well be silent and are of high quality. I really liked the hard drive cage, for numerous reasons. The cage can be taken out entirely, or slid back and forth to allow room for a 3rd front intake fan. The drive bays also include rubber grommets that can easily be moved around to allow for new HDD types. My previous case did not have these mounting points, so this was a big bonus for me. The hard drive ""slides"" are also made of metal and NOT plastic as is very common, so they were an absolute breeze to use.

All in all, this is probably the best case I've ever owned, and I've spent a LOT of money on a LOT of cases in the past. It should also be noted that this case actually provides excellent airflow, and I'm very thankful someone out there still understands basic case design over pure aesthetics.
Cons: My only gripes are most likely due to my own incompetence, but they are thus-

1. The window does not sit flush with the case. The included screws to mount the window have threads that are much too short. I ended up just using standard black thumbscrews instead, after finally giving up on getting the included screws to ""hook"" and thread in again.

2. Removing the front mesh panel (metal, not plastic thankfully) was a bit awkward. I wish it had a bit more room for my fingers to actually reach in and remove it as stated on the instructions. My fingers are by no means fat, and I can see people having issues with this.

3. Instruction pamphlet was a very anemic. I would have appreciated more in-depth text and explanations. The pictures included are passable, but I've had much better manuals included.
Overall Review: All in all, I would highly suggest anyone out there into buying a Fractal case. Their entire lineup seems well known for being of solid, and quiet designs. You pay a small premium, but I've pad a lot more for a lot worse. 5/5",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Build quality
- Compact size
- Tempered glass side panel
- Airflow
- Modern/no over-the-top gamer looks
- Easy cable management (which is impressive for such a compact case)
Cons: These are certainly not deal-breakers, but just some minor nitpicks:
- Front mesh and dust filter are not two separate parts (unless I'm mistaken), so I guess the whole thing gets rinsed with water
- Wish it came with just one extra fan (doesn't affect my build, but others may need it)
- More pronounced lip to catch the glass panel on the side when removing
Overall Review: Overall, I'm absolutely in love with this case. It looks modern and my rig can finally breath again thanks to the great airflow in this case. It is a bit louder than the H440 I had, but I'm willing to sacrifice that for lower temps and a better-looking case. Did I mention the reflections on the tinted tempered glass panel? Because they look gorgeous. Also, the tint really accents the parts that are lit by LEDs inside the case and makes it look very slick.

- Decent cable management
- Tinted tempered glass gives some attitude to the lights inside if you have any

Cons: - Included fans provide about half the RPMs of the Corsair AF120 fans I installed alongside them, not sure if that’s the way they’re meant to operate or if that’s what my MOBO decided to push to them
Overall Review: I am extremely pleased with this case overall. I realized most cases in the market like to restrict air intake for some reason by blocking the front of the case, so by keeping the front open, this case offered just what I was looking for and delivered. I’ve been monitoring my temperatures and so far it has kept everything inside cool after hours of gaming with it. Looks great, offers good airflow, and makes it a joy to build with. I would definitely recommend this case, especially if you absolutely don’t need any CD drives as this case sacrifices that for a full on air intake.",0.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

I saw some reviews that people didn't like that look, but i think it looks great.
-Cable management is A+
- the dust filter on the front panel comes off easy and is easy to clean. Works well at keeping the dust out of the inside of the case.
-Great airflow and many options for fan placement. I'm using (2) 120mm + (1) 140mm fans in the front and (1) 120mm on the back to vent. Great temps on CPU and GPU. Get enough fans in there and you turn down the RPMs to make them quiet.
Cons: -if you want to use the 3.5"" drive bays below it makes for a trickier install. Not much wiggle room with the drive cage and power supply in there. Made me wish it was like an inch longer. If you don't need the 3.5"" drive cage, no worries.
-Need to be careful installing the MB standoffs. I stripped one by over tightening.
-The two included fans are not great in regards to noise or airflow. They're not the worst, but I swapped them out right away.

smallest midtower I have ever worked with, and it all fits and looks amazing!

bottom dust filter comes out the front.

front dust cover pops off without removing the front panel or side panel.
Here's how: After you pull bottom filter, put fingers up into slot on the bottom of the faceplate. Use thumb of same hand to catch the front dust cover. put opposite hand on top of case. Just when you think you might break something pushing up with your fingertips, the front cover pops out. Slide it down and then away to detach the top catches.
Cons: The standoff holes are threaded, but the finish gums them up for a tight fit. start them by hand first and be careful.

have to pop the whole front off to access the front left fan screw holes easily, but it's a rework of the define c

could be half an inch taller at the top for radiators, but this is a rework of the define c, so i'm not complaining.

I have had far worse building experiences with cases costing twice as much. i give this case a gold star!

it might be tricky to hide led strips, but it is a small case.

If you are serious about cooling, plan on either moving the included fans to exhaust, or get rid of them. they seem solid, but they won't give you a good positive pressure as intakes. use some noctua ippc 2000's or another pressure fan for intake.

- Easy to remove dust filters.
- Small footprint
- Simple aesthetic
Cons: The minor gripes:
- The USB 3.0 cable is flat and difficult to route to my motherboard's header at the bottom of the board and I don't know if it is just my case but the way the two cables were attached to the front IO panel meant that the cables overlap in a way that made it impossible to neatly route one on top of the other. Neither would not have been an issue if the cables were round.
- All the cabling is black except the front IO panel audio at the connector. Everything... but one small spot, it really bothers my OCD. I will be getting an extension cable now.

The slightly less minor gripe:
- Somebody was not paying attention when they assembled the case as the rear 120mm fan was missing a blade and it wasn't damaged in shipping as the missing fan blade is nowhere to be found in the packaging. But I was going replace it with a better 4-pin PWM fan anyway so it doesn't bother me much.
Overall Review: - I would recommend this case to anyone looking for a mid-tower that looks elegant and has room for plenty of cooling options.
- Important Note! Other reviews mention this but make sure you check your component clearances against the Fractal Design Meshify product page. This case makes the most out of the atx mid-tower form factor and leaves nothing to spare.",0.0,14.0,16.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

The case design is simple and professional, but still has just enough of a edgy look to it to stand out.
-Very small compact design for an ATX case. Considerably smaller than the BeQuiet SILENT BASE 600 that I transferred my build.
-I really like the darker tinted glass more than I thought I would. I've always avoided windowed cases in the past, but the darker glass gives the case an excellent ""Dark Tower"" aesthetic. It looks very sexy with the red and black theme I have going on inside the case (with red LED lighting as well). The darker glass also helps hide any potential minor dust buildup before cleaning inside the case would be required, since I'm really OCD about that kind of stuff.
-Great build quality. I purchased the Fractal Design's first Arc Midi case several ago, when the company was brand new, and I have to say they have improved the fit and finish a lot.
-The I/O is simple, but I like it. The power button and a very nice and tight tactile feel to it.
-Have to mention the cable routing as everyone else has, it really does help tremendously. I was able to route everything but the CPU power cable along the main deep channel. Makes everything look very nice and tidy.
Cons: -It would have been really nice to have a small cut out in the PSU shroud for the GPU PCI-e cables as others have mentioned. The more direct routing would have given my red braided cables a cleaner look.
-Not a real con but the Fractal logo in the front is a little crooked out of the box, but the 2 screws that hold it in-place can be loosened so you could straighten it out.
-Not a real con, but the front mesh filter is a little tricky getting off. You have reach in at the bottom of the front panel and push in a really stiff plastic clip to get the filter off.
-Maybe more fans included, but at the price point this case comes in at, I'm not going to complain.
Overall Review: This is a small case that fits full sized ATX motherboards, but that said, there are GPU length limits with front AIO radiator installations, limited 3.5 inch hard drive installations, and PSU length limits should be known to the buyer before they order this case. This is a small ATX case that provides a lot of room for its size, but it's still a small case at the end of the day.

As far a sound dampening goes, the only panel you could even cover with it, is the right side panel, which would have the least amount of sound escape anyway. So I could see why Fractal skipped using it.

I used 4 BeQuiet PureWings 2 fans from my previous case (x2 140mm in the front, x1 140mm up top, x1 120mm in the back) and despite the focus on airflow, I still felt the the case was very quiet. Oh... I only used the BeQuiet fans because I'm totally OCD about all my fans looking uniform. So it was either buy 2 more Fractal Design fans (which are solid fans BTW), or just use the really good BeQuiet fans I already had.

I finally gave up on having an optical drive. I realized that I don't ever watch Blu-Ray movies on my PC, maybe the once or twice a year I'll rip an old music CD into MP3's, and on rare occasions I might fire up an old game with still requires the disk that I don't have on Steam. At any rate, I have an extrenal DVD-drive that I paid less than $30 for for those occasions when I actually need it. BUT... I have to admit that with that tempered glass side, my build looks amazing. Didn't realize how much those 5.25 inch drives bays muddied up the aesthetics of a case",1.0,8.0,9.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,JOHN G.,Ownership: more than 1 year,Verified Owner,11/24/19 10:52,3.0,"Pros: The main reason I considered this case is because it breaks the current trend of good looking, but very low airflow cases which cause thermal throttling issues (Particularly on modern GPUs, which can start to throttle if you go past 60C).

- The price on this case is very reasonable for what you're getting. I don't think anything else really competes with this case in terms of value.

- Build quality is extremely good. Nothing about it feels or looks cheap and it is incredibly well designed.

- This case offers high airflow and is an excellent choice if you intend to use a large air cooler. The NH-D15 will fit, but you may only be able to use the central fan depending upon your motherboard and RAM. I was only able to use the center fan with mine, because I couldn't seat the other fan low enough to clear the glass side panel. It doesn't make much of a difference though, because the airflow is very linear and unobstructed in this case. I have two NF-15 fans up front, and that makes the second fan on the NH-D15 less relevant in my opinion. This setup is cooling my 8700k just fine, so it should work with most processors.

- This case is EXTREMELY quiet with two Noctua NF-14 fans in front and the stock 120mm Fractal (GP-12 I think) in the rear. Many high airflow cases are loud, but the foam in the front panel does a good job of keeping noise down. It is completely silent unless it is under a heavy load, and even then it is not particularly loud. My Fractal Node 804 is much louder (And it runs hotter).

- Very compact for an ATX case, but not so compact that it loses essential capabilities. It still has enough room to mount oversized GPUs and large CPU heatsinks. The case is so compact that I honestly didn't believe the NH-D15 would fit when I took this case out of the box, but it does. It also has ample room for storage drives as long as you're not trying to build a server or something. You can fit two 3.5"" drives in the hidden drive cage and two 2.5"" drives on a vertical mount in the rear without disturbing airflow or aesthetics at all. Plus, you have PCIe and NVME options on your MB. There are no issues in that regard, and I think a lot of these cases that come with 10 drive cages are rather silly for the average consumer.

- As a quick aside, the drive cage sleds are very nice. They snap into place with a very satisfying click and the rubber dampers in them work quite well. My WD Gold HDD is silent in the hard drive sled.

- This case is essentially flawless when it comes to cable management. They put a lot of thought into the placement of pass through slots. You will find that they are in all the right places and they've even angled the pass throughs for the 24 pin and SATA ports. This makes it significantly easier to install these cables. You will see what I mean when you build in it. This is the cleanest build I've ever done, and the design made it incredibly easy. There are no large cable runs in the ""presentation side"" of my case. They've placed pass throughs in such a way that virtually every cable comes out of a pass through and only needs to travel 1 or 2 inches to the connection point on the motherboard. There are multiple pass throughs for the front fan cables and they are placed behind the fans, so that you don't even see the cables leaving the fans. They go straight into the rear of the case and can then be passed back through to connect them the motherboard. There is a large channel in the back of the case with velcro straps (Very high quality velcro that wont degrade rapidly) where you route all of your power supply cables. It is very deep and allows everything to be routed in a simple, linear fashion. Cables then leave this channel and go through the appropriate pass through to the intended connection on the MB. There are no ""rats nests"" anywhere in this build, even in the rear of the case. It is so clean back there that I almost wish side panels were TG so I could show it off.

- The dark tinted glass actually looks great in person. You can see the lights through it quite easily, and it makes the inside look cleaner in my opinion, since you mostly see lights ""floating"" in the case and you get glimpses of components. Honestly, the ugly brown Noctua colors actually look awesome through this tinted glass, lol. My NH-D15 is really cool looking in this case, but I know it would not be if the glass was clear. One major benefit to the tinted glass panel is when you're using your computer at night in a dark room. Nobody talks about this, but the tint ensures that your case isn't annoyingly bright in a dark room. It also looks a lot more glossy than the pictures on here. I love it.
Cons: - Honestly, for the build I intended to do, there is nothing negative about this case. I guess it may not be ideal for custom watercooling setups, simply because it is designed to be a compact high airflow case. If you use this case for its intended purpose, I believe you will be very happy.

- Some people dislike the tinted glass, as it is rather dark. I think it looks incredibly classy. This isn't the typical ""gamer"" looking case from 10 years ago. The glass lets through light, so it has just enough show to keep you satisfied, but it doesn't look hideous and ""over the top"" if you put it in your living room.
Overall Review: If you want airflow, your choices are very limited these days. The competing cases in this price point all suffer from restrictive airflow, to the point that you will experience reduced performance. See the research Gamers Nexus has done on this topic if you're in any doubt. Most of the cases with solid front panels do not allow enough airflow and cause pointless thermal issues. There are only a handful of cases on the market right now that won't cause thermal issues, and the Meshify C happens to be one of them. How silly is it to buy a case that causes throttling on your GPU and makes your CPU run far hotter than it needs to? The Meshify C looks great and, more importantly, it wont hold your hardware back. The Silverstone RL-01 is also worth considering, but you can't fit an NH-D15 into that case. The Silverstone Primera SST can fit the NH-D15, but it is double the price of the Meshify C.",0.0,7.0,8.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

CPU: i7 770k
Cooling: Corsair H100i V2
Fans: Corsair HD120 RGB x6 (2 went to the CPU cooler)
Mobo: MSI Z270 Gaming M7
RAM: Corsair Vengeance RGB 2x8gb (4 sticks will fit easily)
GPU: EVGA GTX 970 FTW
PSU: EVGA G3 750W Modular PSU
Storage: Samsung 840 EVO 120GB SSD, and WD 1TB HDD
Fun Stuff: Corsair Commander Pro, Corsair Lighting Node Pro, and an Corsair HD120 RGB controller.
-Cable management was very easy, despite wiring for all the fans and the additional wiring for all the RGB goodies.
-Hooray for Velcro straps!
-Tempered glass is tinted perfectly if you want a well lit build that doesn't blind you/distract you while you're gaming.
-The case is near silent almost all the time
-My CPU never saw above 70C despite OC@5.0Ghz and gaming.
-The added foam padding to the tempered glass and the side panel really helps reduce noise.
-The edges of the tempered glass panel are blacked out so it wont show fingerprints.
- Movable HDD bay to fit fans in front and allow your PSU enough room is a huge plus!
-HDD and SSD mounting is beyond simple.
-There's a nifty removable panel near the front of the case.
-The removable dust filter at the bottom removes from the front of the case and the magnetic cover on the top will make it a breeze to clean.
-Bottom shroud makes hiding cables a breeze and gives the build a clean look.
Cons: -I could not do a top mount radiator with a Corsair H100i V2 due to RAM clearance. This could be more of an issue with taller RAM vs. the case itself.
-The plastic on the front edge is glossy and throws off the sleek look a bit (if this was matte, it would be a perfect design aesthetically)
-The front dust filter is a bit awkward to remove, but after a few tries it gets easier.
Overall Review: -If the case was 4-5mm taller, I feel like any top mount radiator would fit despite RAM height, but I wont knock an egg off as that really isn't Fractals fault.

Cons: Glass shattered on install. I still had the protective film on the glass, which thankfully kept the glass pieces from going everywhere. I must have had a defective glass panel, after seeing Science Studio's drop test of a tempered glass panels, and Fractal offering to warranty the glass panels. This would not have been that big of a deal, however, this was almost two months ago, and I have not gotten an update on where the replacement glass is. At this rate, I might as well have gotten a case with a metal side panel and just thrown the side panel in the garbage.

Overall Review: Overall this case is amazing to work with. It has absolutely no wasted space and my temps on my 7700k have improved. The teselated front panel is so sexy! You will need to plan your build out before working with this case as it does have space limitations.

Overall Review: First, the good parts. The case looks great, it's build like a tank with solid metal casing. It has several mount points for fans, adapters and gaskets for things like hard drive , power supply, and motherboard mounting.

The weakness is the side panel. I upgraded my PC about 18 months after building it, which required taking the tempered glass side panel off. It came off ok( 4 thumbscrews ) , but when I put it back on the case, it shattered into pieces. ( see pics ).

That's not even the bad part. I tried to get a replacement panel for the case since I liked it minus the shattered part. I went to their parts ordering site, and discovered that the panel wasn't in stock. That was in April 2019. It's still out of stock at the end of November.

Not wanted my PC to lack good airflow, which requires an enclosure, I dusted out my PC ( open cases are invitations to dust ) purchased a Corsair mid tower case ( all metal sides! ) to replace the Fractal Meshify C Case.

If you do a search, you'll find others who had the same problem, and also could not purchase a replacement tempered glass panel. They either made their own panel ( kudos to those with the skill , time, and facilities to do so ) or replaced the case as I did.,

My recommendation is to avoid this case, and similar cases with shatter-prone side panels.",1.0,4.0,5.0,67.0,248.0,0,1,1

Overall Review: I bought this case when it came out to replace my then favorite case the Rosewill Cullinan. This case is literally the case that I have always been looking for but didn't exist. The Define C was available but at the time it wasn't tempered glass and cooling wasn't great according to reviews. This case is a wonder and has almost every single thing I want in a case except for one thing.

-3 velcro tie downs to secure the main looms
-many small hooks to tie down smaller cables behind the motherboard tray
-many fan mounts make light work
-power and reset buttons have satisfying click to them
-every screw needed was included and painted black for a seamless look
-SSD mounting location is pretty ingenious. I wasn't sure it would get enough airflow behind the mobo tray and I worried its proximity to the CPU's heat could be a problem, but it's been fine. My SSD idles at 38ºC and creeps up into the low 40s with load. Granted, this is 10 degrees hotter than the HDD that enjoys direct airflow, but the temperature actually falls a few degrees when CPU load increases and the case fans spin up. It's a bit of a compromise to tuck away the SSD here, but my idle temps remain below 40ºC so I guess I'm happy.
Cons: -The 8 pinch latches that secure the front panel hurt my fingers and must be removed to install the front fans. It gets a bit easier after the first time, but it's never fun.
-The front grille/dusk-cover is similarly difficult to remove. There are two latches at the top, two clips in the middle and one long clip at the bottom. To make future maintenance easier, I'm careful not to secure those center clips. The center clips are easy to undo with the side panels off and a screwdriver, but who has time for that.
-The accommodations for 3.5"" hard drives are stupid. The two-disk tray is mounted the wrong way for good airflow and would not allow my modular power supply to fit. Removing the tray and securing one drive to the case floor is better, but there's not a millimeter of space to spare between the hard drive and the bottom row of my modular plugs. Fortunately, I only use 3 of the 8 ports. I don't understand why the hard drive must mount here and not an inch further forward.
-Mounting a fan to ventilate the PSU tunnel means removing the shroud plate which reveals sloppy wiring coming out of the PSU. Pushing air through this location is the only way to ventilate the 3.5 and 2.5 inch hard drives. This shroud plate should have allowed space for a fan when in place.
-The tinted glass is darker than I imagined it would be. If the window is a selling point for you, you need some kind of illumination. I have none and all I can see is the top of my Noctua D14.
Overall Review: I like this case. The Fractal Design aesthetic really stands apart from competitors. In the future, I'll likely replace my 3.5"" drive with an SSD so that I can reinstall the PSU shroud plate and have a cleaner look. If the SSD temperatures become a problem, I'll add a third intake fan for the front so that positive pressure can force air to the far corners of the case (I presently have 2 intake, 2 exhaust).",0.0,3.0,4.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-the Quality
-the accessories that come with the case
-2 fans (will add something to that later)
-tempered glass (tinted)
-nice cable management
-has a full size PSU shroud (Finally a company that does that!)
Cons: -If you work with Watercooling in this case you will take a gamble
-top options for a watercooler is tricky (get to that later)
-HDD if you still use mechanical can be tricky to store if you have a bigger PSU
-the Fans that came with the case are 3-pin fans, they could have added 4-pin fans
Overall Review: I reused my Arctic Freezer 240 and did not want to strip 2 fans of this amazing AIO, the memory which is 2 sticks of Corsair Vengeance LPX 3200 fit tight into the case. The GTX 1060 6GB SCC from EVGA is big but within specs to fit in this case as per Fractal.
Now if we combine all that into a build well start sweating. The front Mounting option for the AIO was out of the picture due to the PUSH PULL on the AIO (Arctic Freezer comes with 4 fans). So I had to unmount the rear fan and start measuring the distance of the Memory and the Northbridge and the AIO. It fit, it is so tight that it almost covers the Pump (not really but close). the Memory if you go low profile is no issue here. Northbridge on my ASUS Crosshair VI Hero (WIFI) is also a very tight fit.

The glass is amazing dark, not allowing you to see all of it but enough to look cool. If you want more insight you will have to get a RGB LED. I have checked something out and it may fit between the AIO and the frame which will give the inside a little more life.

The front mesh of the case is an issue at night if you are picky and want to ultra cool look, as you get a so so look due to the RGB on the board. I would recommend if you have the space to fit 2x 120 RGB fans into the front location so that you that look through look covered.

the Build looks clean and you can do a few things in this case to make it look perfect, as I mentioned RGB Fans in the front (it comes with a standard 3-pin fan) and maybe some RGB 5050 strips on the top.

The shroud has a take out portion so that you can fit a 360 Rad in the front, but be careful the GPU may kill you if the cooler is to big",0.0,3.0,4.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: I feel like the build quality isn't quite up to par with the Define series of cases. I own both the Define R5 and the Define Nano S and both of these feel a little bit more sturdy in construction. For example, the rear side panel and the front panel where the fans screw into feels a bit thin.

I don't like the method for removing the front panel. You have to squeeze these clips together and push them out, and it can be tedious and sometimes painful on your fingers.

The fans use screws instead of rubber mounts and removing/reinstalling the screws requires a lot of torque (plus they don't always go in straight). It might have been better to have some rubber mounts here instead for easier installation and lower noise. Regarding the fan on the front of the case, I am worried that I might warp the metal when tightening the screws because of how thin it is and how much torque is required to get the screw into the fan case.

Because of the power supply shroud, you have to install the PSU cables before sliding the power supply into the case. This means that if you ever need to add more cables, you need to unplug everything first (since you'll need to remove the power supply). If the shroud was removable then perhaps this would be easier.

The included hard drive cage is difficult to use in practice as it is very close to where the power supply sits. The cables from the PSU don't leave a lot of room, and you will have to be creative to make it work (I ended up removing the cage completely). In my opinion it's not really usable unless you have custom sleeved cables that can bend more than the included ones.
Overall Review: The side panel is tempered glass, so be careful as it attracts a lot of fingerprints. It might have been nice to see some sort of oleo-phobic coating here to help with this.

This isn't as silence optimized as some of the other cases in Fractal's lineup are (i.e., Define R5, Define Nano S, etc.). The case fans aren't PWM and the front one in particular is audible during day to day use. Perhaps a low noise adapter could be included in future models.",0.0,3.0,4.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Plenty of ventilation.
- Nice full-coverage PSU shroud.
- Decent amount of cable management space.
- Nice Fractal Design velcro cable straps.
- Dat tempered glass.
Cons: - Max GPU length is only about 290 mm with a radiator mounted in the front (Found that one out the hard way).
- Front dust cover is kind of a PITA to snap out of the front frame, but I think it might become easier over time.
- Since the front panel is just mesh, a lot more noise leaks out of the case, but that isn't a huge deal.
Overall Review: Overall I really like this case and I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a nice, tempered glass case in the <$100 category.

Also, the specs say the recommended max PSU length is 175 mm, but my EVGA G2 is 180 mm and it fit fine. The only downside is I can't really move the HDD trays if I ever want to go with a 360 mm radiator, since they're somewhat tight up against the cables coming out of the PSU.",0.0,3.0,4.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

In case you're still struggling with the front filter, HardwareCanucks has a video at the following link with a fairly helpful demonstration on how to remove it: https://youtu.be/2s32Nw6WoGo?t=1m53s

If you ever do decide to install a 360 mm radiator or otherwise find it necessary to remove the HDD cage, I'd just like to point out that you can still mount a single 3.5"" HDD directly on the case floor. If you don't happen to be using the 2nd tray, it's a great way to free up some extra headroom under the PSU shroud.

The side panels feel more solid, the drive trays feel more solid and have a definite ""click"" when slid in. No doubt you pay more for those cases, but I just expected more from this one. The side panels don't feel solid. The front filter is a chore to remove especially since it's tethered to the case by the cables. When I look at it side by side with my Phanteks P400S, I see that I get way more solid feeling panels. A clean, classy look AND RGB from the Phanteks for the SAME cost. The Meshify C is NOT a bad case, in fact it's pretty good. I think it was my prior experience with Fractal Design cases that made this one miss the mark with me.",1.0,2.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: This was my 1st attempt at building a pc (been building them since win98) for looks in addition to performance and it turned out better than I hoped. I've always used simple, tan or black cases. I think this is the best looking case on the market. I don't think I could've chosen a better 1. I can't stop staring at it, lol! This is also the 1st pc I've built with no optical drive which is still weird to me, but I think it's worth it for the aesthetics. The other side panel hinges at the front which makes installing it so much easier. The filters are easy to remove and reinstall. I'm definitely a Fractal fan from here on out.",1.0,2.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cable management is very easy with many options and good design
Cons: The 3.5” drive cage located across from the PSU seems to be the Achilles heel of this design. I’m still not sure how you’re supposed to connect the cables to the hard drives with the PSU shroud blocking the way, feel free to chime in if you know how. I’ve removed the drive cage and mounted my data drive to the bottom of the case, although that isn’t a very good looking solution. Of course, none of this is a concern if you only use 2.5” drives.",0.0,2.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,0

Nice cable management with built-in velcro straps in the back.

Great overall finish. Very surprised at quality for price.

I love the front angular mesh design. It looks dope.

The tempered glass has the perfect amount of tint for visibility of internals when paired with some RGB case fans. Just so beautiful to look at.

Back panel has two screws with short threads that are fast to take off and resecure. They also stay attached to the panel so they never get lost!

There's a mesh panel that attaches to the top with several magnetic strips. I thought this was a neat solution. No risk of damage re magnets, unless you like to store stuff on top of your case which you shouldn't be doing anyway and the magnets aren't even that strong so it's a non-issue.
Cons: Metal could be a little thicker? But then it would weigh a lot more. It's honestly fine though, and the case feels solid.

The whole front (not just the metal mesh panel) pops off (although you can make JUST the mesh panel pop off if you want), which is nice, but I wanted to point out that this front assembly is indeed plastic and might bother some people. I thought the whole thing was gonna be metal, but whatever. I still like it.

The specifications section should be a little more verbose when it says you can fit a 280 or 360 radiator up front. In order to do this, you have to take out the hdd cage. It doesn't tell you that, I think. I ran out and bought a 240mm aio (H100i V2) and stuck it up top where it just baaaaaaarely clears the ram. It would actually hit the ram, except for the fact that the ram heatspreader tapers off at the ends, so be mindful if you wanna put a 240mm aio up top. Oh, and make sure to connect the cpu power cable on the mobo prior to installing any aio up top. It'll block the connector once in place. If you pay attention, you'd obviously see that, but if you're like me, you end up having to unscrew one of the radiator fans temporarily to gain access.",0.0,2.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,0

Cable management

Material and construction
Did I say price point?
Cons: Front/top panel connectors are attached when removing front panel.
PSU Shroud cutout for GPU power cables, that’s it for me!
Overall Review: Great case overall! I found a new, long time home for my computer, and it’s beautiful! Cable management is great, a bit tight for me but I have an extension cable kit on my semi-modular PSU. I was able to stuff all of the excess cables in the basement without a problem. Installment of the PSU was a breeze. Motherboard, fans, and cooler installation weren’t a problem at all, BUT be aware of the max GPU length if you have a large card like myself. I have an MSI Duke GTX 1080 and theres about 1/8 of an inch between the fan and the card. Airflow isn’t a concern, due to the nice mesh front. I like the design on the front, apart from some, I find it somewhat unique.
I’d recommend this case to anyone who wants a smaller mid tower, with great airflow, cable management, aesthetics, at a GREAT price point. Thanks Fractal Design for the great case! It’ll be with me for a long time :)",0.0,2.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cable management is better than most cases.
Moveable and/or removeable HDD base is a nice feature and one of the things that pulled me towards this from my s340. You can mount a HDD to the floor and shove cables on top.
Cons: It's a bit too small in my opinion especially as compared to other mid towers. While it makes efficient use of the space it is not at all friendly to lighting kits and led strips. There is no area to hide the strips out of view for the glass. And the glass is very dark so lighting is a must or else it is pointless.
While you can fit 140mm fans on the top I don't really recommend it. My fans are pretty much smashing down my 8 pin connector. I also was not able to fit a 280mm radiator and fans on top despite the offset mounting.
Overall Review: If you're not trying to put a lot of wired things in here and if you don't mind visible LED strips it's really a fine case and the front has a very deus ex feel to it which I like just be aware it is smaller than other mid towers and as such there are compromises.",0.0,2.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Great Airflow

Cons: -flaky powder coat interior finish (some of the metal in the corners did not receive a even coat of paint)
-Major quality control issues (See other)
Overall Review: My overall first impressions of this case are great. A nice compact design that can fit ATX parts and components.

When I started my build everything looked and felt normal. When I opened up the back side panel is when things went downhill.
My Hard Drive cage was completely bent at a 45 degree angle, crammed into the lower section of the case. I was able to bend it back to form but I should not have had to do that, the case being new. Following that ordeal, While installing my Motherboard, I found (2) of the Brass Motherboard standoffs stripped. I had to re-thread them with another screw & use an alternate screw other than typical motherboard screw. Lastly the Glass side panel, while intact and with protected film had an oily residue on each of the four corners which I had to wipe off.

I don't know if this was a manufacturing defect or that it was previously used, although the case seemed brand new. I hope that Fractal has better QC in the future. I've always liked their products but this one has me questioning my loyalty.

Would I recommend it? Yes. It is a nice case. This one had major issues though, which I can live with but I am not happy with.",0.0,2.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: - Color was NOT white as shown in the picture. It was more of an off-white gray similar to computer cases of the 90's. Not sure if I just got a bad batch, or if this is standard, but my case was clearly not white.
- Flimsy design, Front panel bends inward with a light touch, bottom filter falls out easily.
- Glass panel extends past the limits of the rest of the case, making the edges stick out. It doesn't look like a deliberate design choice but more of an accident.
Overall Review: If it weren't for the sickly-gray off tone of this case I probably would have kept it but it is definitely not designed to last.

Cable management and airflow is the best I've seen in 20yrs. of building systems. I run an I7-8086@ 5.2ghz. on air (Noctua NH-D15s) with a Gigabyte Aorus 2080ti Xtreme and it keeps my cpu/gpu @ 77c/82c full load after a couple hrs. of gaming @ 25c ambient. 2x140mm intakes, 1 x 140mm chimney, and 1 x 120mm exhaust. No way a front radiator would fit with that video card but then again, that card is a beast at almost a foot long. The ps shroud is a great idea and hides the ps cables while providing a cool base for my video card's ""foot"" since that card weights over three pounds.
Cons: I gave it four stars because I thought the fasteners for the back panel and p/s (can be hand tightened) were cheesy and could easily be cross threaded if not paying attention. DON'T force them.
Overall Review: Makes for a clean build. So many options for cooling and cable routing. If your into RGB it would be an awesome display thru that tinted, tempered glass window.

2) The case is large enough to allow me to do proper cable management, and it comes with zip ties for a clean look
Cons: 1) The front IO is misaligned. I initially thought this was caused by shipping, but upon further investigation, it was attached misaligned. Every time I plug in a USB, it is hell pushing it in and taking it out.
2) The top mesh/filter seems fairly dumb. The bottom slides out, so why doesn't the top? Why is it stuck on via magnets? It doesn't feel like it's part of the case and was added on last minute. It's also not a filter, but just a mesh, so it serves no purpose except for style.
Overall Review: 1) The dark version is actually much darker than I thought. If it was a little lighter and more light shone through, I think it would be perfect. Not completely transparent, but just a tad lighter in tint.

- Liberal use of dustfilters on every vent.
- Solid construction and finish
- Love the all black, low-key design.
Cons: - Non removable front panel. The front IO panel is connected to the chasis, this means you'd have to remove the front panel and leave it on top of the case to install a fan.

I'm not removing an egg for this simply because I don't think this plays a role in performance nor appearance, and likely not something I'll be needing to do a lot.

Cons: The included fans are 3-pin; so PWM fan control may get dicey depending on the mobo. I used an ASUS ROG STRIX B550 - F and they seem to comply with fan speed profiles as needed. I don't know if the 4-pin fans are a must, but it would really round out the install with excellence. Also only 3 case fans; should have 4 fans IMO. 4 4-pin quality fans would have been sweet.

Overall Review: A real shame,

I just finished assembling my new advanced PC!,
I dedicated only the best to it, including a Fractal Meshify C case, which I bought for its beautiful front panel with that irregular triangle pattern, which unfortunately comes almost FLAT in the unit I bought!
I know other Fractal cases with the same front panel and they have a great relief, almost all the triangles on their surface stand out and are perfectly appreciated with the light that illuminates them coming from any direction. I have changed the light that illuminates mine from many angles and it still feels flat and boring.

Cons: The one thing that I did not like about the case and the setup experience, was the fact that the manual that comes with it was fairly sparse and did not have the data that I would have expected to have in a setup manual... There are other things, that will be in the overall review as they are not specifically cons of the case...
Overall Review: I would recommend this product, as it came in 100% new condition, with no scratches or anything, and the tempered glass was also intact... However, I wish that it included a way, for instance one of the PCIe covers having a little notch, to route the Wi-Fi cables on the computer into the case and then behind the motherboard tray where I currently have them routed from, with a modified PCIe cover plate, to where it still covers the PCIe slot, but it allows a thin wire that connects up to my two Wi-Fi plugs on my motherboard to pass through before attaching the PCIe cover back on, with the cable in the little notch or u-shaped groove... Also, it needs to have something for if people want they can take their plastic Wi-Fi cable end and put it behind the motherboard tray like a piece of velcro tape even that you can put on the plastic antenna, because I wanted my Wi-Fi antenna to not just be dangling around and the best way to do that would be just to put it inside the case in a place where it will possibly still have good signal reception, which funnily enough, in the case, it actually does even with all the power and stuff nearby, which I love... And even if you guys that build the case don't add a Wi-Fi antenna spot in the back in my opinion you need to either add something like an extra cover plate that would have the needed connection cutout for the home user to be able to pass through the Wi-Fi antenna into the internals of the case by themselves... I realize a guy can do like I did and do it themselves because of the fact that I have two extra PCIe slot covers due to the fact that I am actually using a two slot PCIe graphics card but it would be nice if you guys at faculty design added something along those lines into the design of the case to where you don't have a couple of foot of that thin wire laying about outside the case to possibly get cut or something... Obviously not every motherboard has Wi-Fi built in and not every motherboard has that type of cable some might just have an actual antenna that just screws on without a cable but I like my cable just the way it is the way I have it so that might be a way for you guys to cater to those who would rather have their stuff all in the case as much as possible...",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Excellent cable flow-throughs that can help make cable management easier.
- Plenty of options for fan placement.
- Good airflow; able to stay whisper quiet.
Cons: - Depending on your power supply and whether or not you want cable extensions, cable management might be an issue.
Overall Review: I bought this case for my first full PC build. Parts: MSI MPG Gaming Carbon WIFI, Ryzen 5 3600, MSI Core Frozr L, MSI GeForce RTX 2070 Super (Twin Frozr), 2x8GB Corsair Dominator 3600, Corsair CX650M, 1x512GB M.2 boot drive, 2x1TB SSDs, 2x140mm Fractal X2 GP-12, and Phanteks cable extensions.

For the majority of the build, this case is fantastic to work in. The quality feels like a steal for the price and there are some aspects of the case that I absolutely love. For example, the 2070 Super is a big, heavy card and I was worried about it sagging. Maybe it's a combination of the board (MSI boasts PCIe Steel Armor on the top slot; they say it adds strength and stability. I'd have to say they're not lying) and the case, but the card doesn't sag or, if it does, it's minimal. The two slots in the case that allow the card to mount in for stability are fairly snug. Thus, the card is not able to wiggle much when installed and even without the mounting brace, the card stays quite level.

Another great feature are the dust screens. The top screen is held in magnetically and is easy to set and remove if you want to add, adjust, or remove fans from up top. The lower dust screen removes from the front so you don't have to move the case to get after it. The filter behind the mesh in the front of the case is another story.

I want to say here, before I list my quibbles with the case, that overall, I think the case is really quite good. I'll have more to say about that at the end, but I don't want the impression to be that I think it's highly flawed. There are just trade-offs you should consider.

The wiring for the power, reset, front-side audio and 2 USB 3.0 ports pass from the front cover into the main body of the case. Thus, any time you un-clip the front, you're limited by that wiring - i.e., you can't just take the front of the case off and set it aside. An improvement might be to have those features moved back onto the actual case and off of the removable front panel. Then you could remove the front panel and set it aside. This would be a huge bonus because, while taking the front panel off is easy, separating the pieces of the front panel to clean, remove, or change the filter, is not at all easy - especially when you can't remove the front panel away from the case (unless you want to disconnect the cables from the motherboard, undo the wire ties, and feed the cables out of the case, of course). Even mounting fans in the front of the case (where I dropped the 2x140mm Fractals) isn't as easy as it could be.

Next, I might caution you if you are interested in cable extensions. The power supply I chose is semi-modular, the 8-pin and 24-pin power cables are hard installed. Adding cable extensions means that you'll almost certainly need the entire basement to store extra cables; thus, you won't be able to leave the hard drive tray installed in the case. The second downside here is that, because the basement is full of cables, it's unsightly to remove the forward tray from the basement and install a 3x120mm arrangement of fans. You can do it, but you'll be left looking into a cavity just behind the bottom fan that's stuffed full of cables.

I had originally ordered the EVGA 240 CLC AIO cooler for the CPU. I knew that the GPU was going to be too long to install the radiator in the front of the case, but I thought I'd have clearance to install it in the top of the case. This was not so. Perhaps the heatsinks on the MSI board are just taller than average, but the cooler misses clearance by about 1cm of height. Thankfully I could return it and switch to the air cooler.

Overall, the case is very good. I'd still recommend it to others if they were comfortable with the limitations. The build of the case is very high quality and I'm quite happy with how the PC turned out.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Compact: The size of a Fractal Define C Silent (H x W X D)

-Build quality (No stripped holes, or flimsyness)
-included screws, cable ties and motheerboard standoffs in a nice small box.
-storage options
-workspace within the case (take the time to plan your build)
Cons: The following are really nitpick points and not necessarily ""cons""
-Glass panel loves fingerprints, unavoidable really.
-Integrated front I/O to the front frame. This makes it cumbersome to install the front fans or swap out the mesh panel becuase the front panel cables are attached to the frame.
Overall Review: I selected this case to complete a simple RGB build since RGB is all the rage, and for gaming from time to time.

I use Deepcool CF140 X 2 up front, DeepCool CF120 X 1on the heatsink, and Deepcool CF120 X 1 in the exhaust location. I covered up the top outlet mesh area, that usually holds the magnetic dust filter, with a Moduvent cover from a Define C. I felt that the amount of airflow thru the case was more than sufficient even with the top outlet mesh area covered because I don't overclock this system.

Altogether pleased with the design prowress of Fractal cases.

I run 100% air cooled. The best set up for me, was (1 intake) 120mm front fan, (2 intake) 140mm front fans, (1 intake) 120mm bottom fan, (2 exhaust) 140mm top fans, (1 exhaust) back fan 120mm.

Airflow is fantastic due to its front and top mesh panels. The four rubber grommets allow for clean cable management. I personally love the aesthetics of the case as well. My favorite aspect of the case is that it supports so many case fans of all different sizes in many different positions. I have two front-mounted 140mm intake fans and two 140mm exhaust fans that are mounted to the top of the case. Temps are fantastic for my i9-9900 and RTX 2060 Super due to superb airflow. Fantastic dust filtration is a big plus for this case as well.
Cons: The case is relatively small and difficult for someone with big hands like myself to connect the PSU and front panel connectors to the motherboard. I had to do a lot of prior planning for cable management to make sure everything would fit properly. It’s a spacious case that supports a great assortment of hardware, however, it’s just a tad bit difficult to work in at times.
Overall Review: Overall, I would highly recommend this case for someone who is in the market for a relatively affordable mid-tower case with great features. It’s well-constructed and aesthetically pleasing to look at as well. Look at the photos that I posted below to see how tight cable management can be if you’re someone that has big hands like myself.

Amble room for fans or AIO cooling with 120mm and 140 mm fan compatibility.

I got the white with the non-tinted glass. Looks amazing and the mesh front is what I was looking for so that my Corsair AIO H100iv2 could breathe and keep my AMD R9 3900x at 70 deg under full load.
Cons: BUT... it's too narrow to fit both my AIO and my RTX 2070... Just needed another inch and it would have been fine. I switched back to the stock AMD fan and my temps are up to 83 deg.

Cons: Bad manufacturing. The motherboard riser screws included with the case do not fit the case. You can do a search for this ""Fractal case motherboard screws don't fit"" Some have damaged cases trying to fix it, DON'T!! NewEgg has to take these back and pay shipping both ways, its a defect.

If you do want to compete the manufacturing process for Fractal be careful. Even they will warn you that if you dent the case attempting to finish the job of Fractal employees and bend the case you are stuck with it.

The first two screws seem to be the worst for most customers. In my case the screw wont even begin to start threading so I would have to apply a ton of pressure to thread these holes.

It stinks as we just sat down with the kids to build this computer.
Overall Review: Only good news is I did all this in front of my kids and got a ""I will never buy from these guys"". So something was learned.

- Aesthetically nice design
- Nice cable management space in the back
Cons: - Motherboard sits a bit high, preventing placement of CPU radiator in the top
- If placing radiator and fans in the front, long GPUs like my Gigabyte 2070 Super, sits about 1 or 2 mm off of the front fan/radiator setup (I'm using a fan pulling setup so my fans are behind the radiator, pulling air through it.
- Only 120mm fan supported in the rear
Overall Review: -My fan setup is 120mm in the rear (exhaust), x2 120mm in the top (exhaust), and x2 140mm in the front with radiator.
- The shroud in the bottom does a nice job at hiding the PSU, HDD, and cables while adding to the overall aesthetics of the case; kind of like black trim on a sports car.
- The case feels cool throughout the day; CPU temp (i7-9700k) avg is about 30c, GPU is about the same under mild load.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

This didnt matter for me cause it was a new build, but I like that there is a panel to access the back side of the mother board if you want to swap aio and need to get to the mounting bracket. The panel looks great and air flow is amazing. Sound dampening is also amazing. 5 egg case
Cons: This isnt really a con as it's kinda dead tech but there isnt anywhere to mount an optical drive. The cable routing systems goes right over the storage bays making me dread having to replace a drive. This con might just be related to my motherboard but the lower pci slot barely clears the tray hiding psu and storage leaving next to no room for airflow under my GPU, moving up to the upper slot doesnt leave much room for water cooling pipes. The gap on the backside could be larger for rgb and fan hubs, they fit, but super snug. And lastly keep in mind that this is a compact case there is about a 3/4 inch gap between my front fans and my gpu (2070super) with my lengthy card front mounting a radiator wasnt an option
Overall Review: Great qaulity and the easiest case I've ever built in. Would highly recommend this case, its simple sleek design is timeless and will never look dated, you'll have no problem using this case over multiple builds as long as GPU's dont get bigger.

Cons: It would be nice if they included just a couple more of every screw, and things. Just because screws get lost, and sticking a shiny silver screw in instead of what is supposed to be there, don't look right.
if you want to use a front AIO, make sure of your gpu length, or AIO dimensions. A triple fan gpu, (as i have), won't work with a front AIO, as the gpu is about 1/2"" short of the system intake fans.
Overall Review: I run a I7-9700k o/c'd with a msi trifrozer rtx 2070 o/c'd with 32Gb ram 3200Mhz and a evo 212 air cooler push-pull (fan front and back of cooler). Unless i'm stress testing or setting up a new o/c profile, i don't hit even 70c.

Overall Review: Overall this is a really great mid tower case. I switched from the Phanteks Enthoo Pro to the Meshify C and I'm glad I made the move. The Enthoo Pro was way too big and wasting a lot of space. The Meshify C is a good size that fits all my parts and I still have room for more drives or fans. The airflow in this case was the main draw for me and the temps stay nice and cool with my fan layout (3 front intakes, 1 back exhaust, 1 top exhaust). I like my all black with dark TG look but I'm sure adding RGB would also look good. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone whether it's their first or third PC build.

The hardware came neatly packaged in the HDD/SDD trays and the room you have to work with for cable management is very nice.
Cons: the thumb screws come from the manufacturer torqued on pretty good, just a minor inconvenience. Also, only remove the glass with the tower on its side, that glass panel will give you a heart attack when you remove the last thumb screw and tempered glass will shatter if it hits just right (or wrong)

-Full front mesh panel
-Power supply shroud covers the entire bottom of the case and part of the top is unscrewable
-Power supply fan can be facing up toward the middle of the chassis or down and out of the case
-Enough room for lots of fans
-Support for both 140 and 120mm fans in certain spots
-Looks good and clean
-Tempered glass panel (more durable than acrylic)
-Interchangeable front mesh to be different colors (different colored mesh is sold separately but it comes with a black one)
-Cable grommets to route cables through for good cable management
-Tie-down points on the back of the case for good cable management
-USB 3.0 on the front panel io
-Compact and smaller than most standard atx cases
Cons: -The cable holes on the top and bottom of the case are hard to fit certain cables through (rubber grommets on the side are fine)
-Only comes with 8 mobo standoffs and screws but most ATX mobos use 9
-Would've like the case to be a bit longer so that the PSU would be bigger in order to stuff some of the longer cables in there
-In order to put the 120mm fan in at the bottom of the case the hdd mounting tray must be removed
-The case says it can support two 140 mm fans and one 120 mm fan in the front of the case but you can not put the bottom 120 mm in unless you remove the hdd trays and holder
-Even without the hdd trays and holder mounted the 120 bottom screws dont screw in that well
-Only comes with two 120mm fans (Not really a con but I added two more 140 mm and one more 120 mm)
-SATA SSDs must be mounted to the back of the case, whereas some cases allow them to be mounted to the front of the chassis to show them off if they have RGB or look nice

Right side panel also is easily removed, solid steel. Easy to remove and clean filters (top, bottom, front).
Cons: Not a big deal, but would perhaps suggest adding one or two small tiny loop brackets for cable ties at the very top of unit in main area in the event cables or LEDs are run above (similar to back by SSDs).

Everything works as it should of course, and the mesh feels amazing and I sometimes find myself just touching it when I'm chilling.
Cons: One singular con, which I won't deduct an egg for is that when installing a fan behind the front mesh, you have to pop out the mesh. Just an FYI to future buyers, taking this mesh out will be the hardest part of your build. You must pull out the tray from underneath, then push up at the front bottom of the case until the mesh pops out. This will take a lot of force, and you might break a finger or two. Watch a video before doing so, it looks very easy but is very hard. You will feel like you are gonna break it but you won't.

I was able to fit everything in perfectly and the cable management and power supply enclosure really made the build look nice and compact. Everything went perfectly, up until I removed the glass side panel to move aside a cable. After unscrewing the hand-tightened screws I carefully pulled the panel away from the case at which point the entire panel exploded shooting shards of glass all over me. The panel never touched another object and I was extremely careful when removing it, so I was surprised (to say the least) at the damage. After doing a quick search I found that a lot of people have had Fractured Design cases exploded on them due to defects in the tempered glass. Also, they can take months to replace the panel, an item which they usually sell separately and should already have on hand. On the day I built my PC the thing breaks. Maybe if I had it a year or two I could see that happening but literally an hour after finishing the build? I've built a lot of PC's but I've never had this happen with another case. I'm just hoping I don't have to remove all the components and rebuild in another case.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,0,0,1

Clean simple design.
Tinted glass is very nice.
Ample room.

Appears to have good intake and exhaust flow through bottom,front, and top mesh. Only side glass and metal panels do not have air options.
Cons: - Some minor paint chips and some of the screws were so tight paint came off when unscrewing.
Not too bad only like 3-5 micro locations.
- Only 2 fans and old style 3pin.
- Wiring somewhat bulges the steel side cover.

-doesnt get to hot, very quiet, breathes well
-topside magnetic mesh is great when the cat decides to shed on everything i own or love
-doesnt have the ""12 year old fork knife gamer aesthetic"" that prioritizes glass and massive blue fans that give you visual cancer, looks refined and professional with a fun edge due to the front panel's angular styling. it looks like a fitted suit or business man's 12 cylinder amg. practical, but fun. this kept my wife from accusing me of building a pure boy toy gaming machine despite what i put inside of it
-has a pin instead of a screw to help center your mobo in place before screwing, INCREDIBLY HELPFUL WHY HAVEN""T I SEEN THIS ELSEWHERE?
Cons: -the front panel comes off entirely with power switch and usb cables still attached, not great not terrible. hard to balance while screwing in the front fan one slot up

Roomy
Good layout
Easy to install
Cons: Some cables from the Power supply may have to be run in a way that makes installing the power supply a bit tricky. May need to buy cable extenders.
Overall Review: This is the first case I have bought in a long time so I did a lot of research. This companies cases always came up high on the ratings so I decided to try it. I was really impressed with the cable management options. The layout was a bit different to make room for using a liquid cooler if you want to. This makes the location of the power supply different then I am used to. But because of the design, I was able to run cables where I needed to and it made it easy to look good. I also really like the tinted glass of the case. It will let out some lights from the inside but not enough to be distracting. The only downside is that you may have to get some cable extenders to be able to run the cables where you need them.

Other than that, I like how the case feels and looks. There is enough room to add more fans if needed but so far my computer is running very cool. There are plenty of places to let the case breathe with the mesh design. Lastly, I have allergies and computers love to attract dusk. The removable filters will make the case very easy to clean and keep the dust from getting inside the case.

Update:

I have my computer completely setup now and I am very happy with the case. The included fans are very quite and the way the case is designed provides enough space for expansion in the future.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

First PC I have built in about ten years and boy have PC cases come a long way. Cable management was a breeze. All of the slots and cut outs make cable routing very easy and the velcro straps on the back are an added plus.

I moved the front included fan to the top and installed two Noctua 140mm PWM fans in the front and case seems to have pretty good air circulation.

Case is pretty quiet (not silent) at low speeds. Not the case's fault but the stock Ryzen 3600 cooler sounds like a hair dryer at high speeds and the case does not dampen the sound very much. Overall quieter than my old Antec 900 and I suspect if I upgraded my CPU cooler it would be near silent.

All of my components fit with no issues.

Cons: - only con i've had is i would have liked it if the case came with some extra fans or extra screws to mount additional fans. there are plenty of spots to do so but the case only comes with 2 fans.

Furthermore, the mesh front panel is perfect for keeping my full AMD system at pretty cool temps.
The tinted glass is beautiful, although you can’t see too much, it makes lights pop out more.
Cons: Its a mid-size tower, so it’s kinda small. My 5700xt just BARELY fit. If there were a longer Meshify C, it would literally be perfect. However, this can be fixed by getting thinner fans.

- Removable drive cage in the basement, but still allows you to hard mount a 3.5"" drive in that basement if you need to.
- 2.5"" drive placement on the back was great.
- Dust filters to help keep my interior clean.
- Many available tie down points for cable management.
- Included some velcro tie down straps pre-installed

-dust filter material in the front can be removed to be cleaned
-cord management was simplified by a large amount of access points from the rear
-comes with straps and zip ties for cord management(front i/o cables are already strapped in)
-included fans are quiet with a very decent amount of airflow at normal operating speed
-glass side looks amazing and has rubber at contact points
Cons: -access points from front to rear could have been a little larger
-with the hard drive bay in place and even a modular psu(power supply unit) cord management can be troublesome especially if you forget to add a cord or want to subtract one (no room and cords for my psu weren't long enough to pull back out with out disconnecting the main lines at least
-also the hard drive bay prevents the addition of the third fan the front of the case
-upper magnetic mesh and the mesh trey on the bottom lack any real dust filtering material sadly
-both front usbs works however the microphone and headphone ports barely work unless i leverage the jack just right and naturally that fails as soon as i let the pressure off
Overall Review: i bought this case for three things 1 it looks great, 2 i have an amd radeon 5700xt sapphire nitro its huge, 309mm and known to get hot so i wanted a case that could accommodate it and allow enough ventilation that my fans aren't in overdrive just from title screens, 3 the price is right in the range i was hoping for and even with the cons i am happy with what i got.
In hind-sight i should have gotten their newer model for the extra space alone and possibly working front jacks there are probably other improvements that have been made on their meshify S? if you don't need front jacks and just need to save some money this isn't a bad case at all. just plan on those ports not working i have seen that problem in other reviews",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- The front panel dust filter should have easier access
Overall Review: Coming from an old Fractal Design R5 case, this is very different. It's a bit louder, as expected, because of the type of case it is compared to the old R5. I like how it's about half the size of the R5 and is still able to fit a full ATX MB on it. The layout of the case is familiar and there's a good amount of room for expansion. You could easily fill this case with a customer water loop, or keep it simple and have a cleaner look inside.

Cons: I added a second front 120 mm fan, and not even that is enough. I have a 1660 TI graphics card and when gaming it is necessary to have all the case fans at maximum speed to get adequate cooling of the graphics card. It's really loud. The front fan mounting holes do not allow a 120 mm fan to be mounted low enough, only a 140mm will work. My previous case was a Corsair 330R Blackout Edition Ultra-Silent, and I was able to get better temperatures form that case, which has limited air flow.
Overall Review: I've ordered 2 Noctua 140 mm fans for the Meshify C, which should help direct air over the graphics card. But for the extra money, that I am spending, I should have just gotten the Meshify S2, which comes with 2x140 mm fans in front stock.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Front USB are only USB 3.0
Overall Review: Overall, to me, this is a perfect case for me. The lack of USB-C on the front panel doesn't matter to me as I don't need it. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a mid tower case.

Several different mounting options for fans.
Captive screws on both the Right side Panel and power supply bracket are great design choices. no clue why my old case didn't have them. Not like it would have taken the designer long to add them.
Cons: Short feet means the bottom Fan intakes for the Power Supply and (optional) case fan location have bad intake potential. Just put some small bottle-caps under the feet to boost it up a little bit and its fine though.

2 120mm fans are not pwm(4 pin)
Overall Review: Was great to build in. Am using some old fans until i get some new PWM fans in.

Removed hard drive cage and plate to use 3 front 120 intake fans. There is an option to mount 1 3.5 inch drive directly to the bottom of the case so if you only need 1 3.5 inch you don't even need the cage. 3 2.5 inch on the behind mobo mount plate are nice and close together. So my 4 plug sata power cable was easily able to reach all 3 and power my fan hub at the same time.

Clearance at the top of the board is great. Was able to plug in my cpu power without problems while a fan was installed.

Still 5 eggs with the couple minor nitpicks

Good spacing for a smaller footprint Mid tower case.

The mesh front and top create characteristics close to running the board open air.
I've been able to run my system with only the CPU fan on half speed and activating the other fans only when the CPU goes beyond 80 degrees.
Cons: The cut outs at the back aren't filtered. You can close those with electrical tape, but airflow to the graphics card will be impacted.
Loud components inside the case will be audible outside - this is the price you pay for solid airflow.
The power button sits too close to the usb 3 ports, which means it's easy to accidentally press.
Doesn't offer front USB-C ports.
Overall Review: I am really glad I bought this case instead of the other contenders. For the price differential, you get solid quality and a case that's got excellent airflow.
I ordered the version with a metal side plate because I though I did not care for the RGB lights, but regret this a little in retrospect, the assembly inside is actually really pretty. Didn't expect that :)",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: If you are looking for a clean, sleek, compact design with tons of awesome features this is the one to go with. I had the Phanteks Enthoo Pro before and it was a hollow shell for me.

Very well thought out design
Plenty of fan mounting
Plenty of storage mounting options
Love the front fractal mesh!
Cons: Make sure to run your sata cables before installing your motherboard. The bottom cut out for cable routing is small and if you have an atx board the head of the data cable will be a struggle to get through. Only a problem if your like me and have to have your storage in sata port 1 on the B450 Tomahawk Max

Excellent support for full size ATX motherboards and clever mounting points for 2.5"" SSD drives.(They are actually on the back of the motherboard tray with enough room for air passage.) Awesome cable tie system for the front panel inputs and lights and easy fan placement both on the top and front. Even after adding a liquid cooling system, the case is light with all the components in there. And, dang it, it looks good!
Cons: There two gripes I have: 1. If you have a cat that likes to jump on your tower to get attention, they will hit the power button that will either set your computer into sleep mode or restart your tower.(minor, I know, but it has to be mentioned.) 2. Even though the tempered glass looks good(and it does), the main problem I have with it is the heat build up and insulation of said heat. I have a Sapphire RX 5700 reference card and normally when farting around on the internet, this beast is running anywhere from 34C to 40C with the stock cooling fan. Not good. I swapped this card into a completely different case with the same spec PC and found while on the internet the card runs 27C to 36C. Better, but the difference is that the Fractal Design case has a pane of tempered glass that traps heat in the case, even with 4 140mm case fans pumping the heat out. Gotta drop an egg for that. Also, the glass pane is glass, so shattering is possible if dropped wrong.
Overall Review: I am not a fan of display cases without a way to vent heat easily out the display window. I would love to have found that the display side of the case had a mesh insert that had points for mounting more fans. Overall, this is a great case for people who want to have a display PC, but not for really hardcore gaming.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Mesh on front has a nice design to it and feels sturdy to give that extra personality.

-Small case, but fits everything nicely. May have an issue with things warming up due to the close proximity if you don't have enough/powerful enough fans. There is space to put a 3rd fan if you're worried, though.
Overall Review: It's smaller than I expected it to be, considering I bought it thinking it would be as big or bigger than my old case, but it packs a big punch and still fits everything just fine. My favorite part is the separate compartment for the PSU and the extra room in the back to feed all the wires through without difficulty.

You get a very modern design complete with functionality other case designers don’t consider providing for the cost. The best comparison would be the NZXT line.

Meshify-C has great airflow and can lower your the heat significantly. I have a i7 10700k @4.8ghz with a Cooler Master Hyper Black 212 and under load seeing 40-45C on CPU temps. I moved my stock fans to the top pulling cool air in and added a HF Fractal exhaust fan to test the flow.

But it! I returned my Kraken X63 new and in the box because I’m so pleased with the case. I have an external Aourus GTX 1070 GPU with its own power and fan supply, so this helps lower my head signature as well.

Overall Review: Overall, this case is pretty cool. It was a pretty large upgrade from my smaller mini atx Thermaltake versa, and this new one gets the job done with style. This case is very sleek and almost too low profile. The magnetic filter on the top of the case is also a nice touch, and is also very easy to remove. The back of the case is very spacious, so for newer builders like me, it makes it very easy to stuff all your cables back there :). The case itself comes with 2 fans, which is pretty good considering the price point. The side glass though, is a different story. While very premium, it is so dark that I would hardly recommend a RGB build inside there. I personally don't like the look of unicorn vomit all over my PC, so a blackout build with hints of rgb is very slick.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

I guess the only negative is somewhat limited space for 3.5"" drives, but given the dual M2 support I didn't find this a big deal. Drives and cables are all hidden in spaces at the bottom of the case and under the motherboard. This creates a completely clean, uncluttered look.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,0,1

- Great build quality and attention to detail.
- Cable routing is a breeze for a mid-tower case option.
- Very clean and minimal look.
- Tempered Glass panel seems of good quality.
-
Cons: - Front panel is a little difficult to get off by hand.
- I would've liked to see a little more detail in the user guide/manual, especially with regards to removing the power supply shroud to have full access to the drive cages. It's a little tricky.
- Me personally, I would've liked to see the price be slightly higher if it meant including 1 additional fan for 3 total. Two in the front, 1 exhaust in the rear -- however I'm sure Fractal just assumes most people will be adding their own or utilizing an AIO radiator in the front of the case anyway. Won't remove an egg for that.
- No USB type C port on front panel. Not removing an egg as it doesn't matter to me personally. I'm more concerned with build quality, thermals and ease of cable management.
Overall Review: Absolutely my favorite mid-tower case on the market right now due to the build quality, thermals, ease of cable routing and price. It has everything a builder really wants in a no-frills, thermal focused case. Nice magnetic dust cover on top, bottom dust cover is easily accessible and slides out easily, and satisfyingly clicks into place when set. Tempered Glass panel is easy to see through on the standard model. Captive screws for the opposite side panel and power supply mounting bracket is a nice touch. Rubber cable guides are always nice to see as well.

Thermal performance is solid, build quality is solid, looks are subjective but I personally think this angular front grill is very unique and very ""fractal"". I love it. I'd absolutely recommend this case to anyone who is set on getting a mid-tower ATX case. Whether you're a pc building veteran or a brand new buyer looking to build their first high end PC, this is a fantastic option and you're not going to be disappointed. It does lack a front usb type-c port, but that doesn't bother me in the slightest. You really can't go wrong with the Meshify C and it's as popular as it is for a reason.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Cable Ties included is a big help
- Cable cutout holes I didn't know I needed until I needed it!
- Movable Drive-Cage and PSU back mounting (it was weird at first, but I love this method better of removing a Power Supply)
- Amazing Air flow coming from the front of the case, the filter doesn't destroy it!
- Filter in the front! amazing! (filters in the bottom too)
-PSU you can mount it 2 ways, up or down, holes everywhere. AIO's users should have the PSU fan up, non AIO' users put your PSU fan facing down!
- The SSD back metal plate mounting is amazing, not only that, because the metal is naturally cooler it might be acting as a heatsink for 3x SSD's since installing I've noticed 5-to-15F* in temperature degree difference (LOWER! WHAT?!) My other case had amazing airflow plus a mini fan near the SSD just for kicks, too. (but that case was too big for mATX and too wide)
I rate this case 9.7 out of 10!
Cons: - It's design is off by half an inch, not even, we're talking about a huge design oversee where if the case would of been 10mm to 16~mm taller and 10mm-15mm wider it would of been perfect for:
A: 240mm rads on top is tight, annoyingly tight, and its putting some pressure on my RAM enough to slight bend the motherboard but not enough to damage it, and my ram isn't really that tall, like come on Fractal ... the front;
B: a few mm's to half an inch (even less) would of been perfect for GPU long cards, I haven't tested yet because I don't have the newer GPU that's 3 bladed instead of 2, So my 280mm AIO in the front might have to be put out of commission due to space issues.
Seriously annoyed but love the case, it needs to be a few mm's bigger in all areas where the customer wouldn't notice the size difference until working inside the case.
- PSU Cabling is a little tight due to the Hardrive Case, but its okay, just put all your cables on your PSU before installing.
- The case has blemishes, micro level when applying certain light to it, all my friends have the same case. different versions but all same case, mines is the only one that came with some scratch like around the PSU shroud towards the glass, about 2 or 3 tiny tiny metal shining through, which was annoying to look at but it doesn't bother me anymore. Also the front sticker protection clear thingy was missing, but everything else was on point, new. Seems like someone peeked in this case or something weird happen during process of this case BEFORE it was packaged. It's not enough to return it and it's only visible if your 3 feet away. I believe this case might of been bumped into something or someone during the process of what ever country this came from, but it's not a big deal, just i know is there, even though i notice or care about it enough to do anything. (not a complaint, just was annoyed that this new case had 2 tiny dots where paint wasn't coated and the protection sticker in the front was missing, but i moved on).
Overall Review: I manage to (at the moment) squeeze 2x AIO's, top: 240mm Corsair, and front 280mm NZXT for GPU-AIO w/ Bracket. But I am going to have problems when newer, bigger GPU comes. The other (Fractal) models were TOO big (ugly space in the front middle). I really wish after a few hundreds sales, Fractal should of halted the case process, and just added a few mm's, i know tooling is probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, but a little disappointed someone in Fractal wasn't thinking "" hey, you can add 2 radiators here if we take a finger, use that as a size and add that space into it. BUT this case, i love it, that's why i put 9.7 out of 10. Yes,
seems like I complain about the case, but its the little things after so long not having a case that annoyed me, but after a few weeks, I'm very happy! Get this case, I'm just picky because I want 2x of my AIO's but this case is solid, filter in front, amazing air coming in the case.
If Fractal comes out similiar small size case with 2x Radiator support, I'll jump to that in a heartbeat, for now, this case is my new lover, and it has a home with me.
Buy it! I know there's a con written on this, but I'll buy this case again if i know what i know now, i'll still purchase it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- There are enough holes for routing the cables and the grommets help hide cables well.
- It came with all the screws necessary for the build; including the ones for the motherboard.
- Sufficient airflow.
Cons: - This is super minor but I would have preferred the power button to have the LED, instead of it being on the front panel.

Cons: Not a good case for non-modular power supply
Overall Review: This is a fantastic case! I was a bit hesitant to purchase this because I've seen FRACTAL cases and I wasn't overall impressed by them. So as I was searching for a case, this came up and I decided to look it over. I'm happy I did because this was a surprised to me. This case has lots and lots of space for anything! The cable straps in the rear are a very nice touch. The space at the bottom where the hard drive cages are and the area where the power supply sits are a nearly tight place. So if you are getting anything in the 1000W power supply range, then this case WON'T work for you. Another thing, I had a bit of a time trying to get the cables managed due to the low rear space. This isn't necessarily a killer for this case but I would say that which ever power supply you choose, for an easy sake, get a FULLY MODULAR power supply. I didn't get one due to whom the computer was going to and I barely got these cables to comply. Overall, this case deserves 5 EGGS! Good on ya FRACTAL!",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: Took the glass side off to check fans literally the first day I was using it as my build was running a little hot. As I was screwing it back in the glass shattered into a million pieces with glass shards making their way into my fans and other components. Not sure if this was just the tension from the screws or what. In the product title this says it is tempered glass, which I guess it technically true, but it is not LAMINATED to prevent glass from ending up everywhere and in your expensive components. It would have probably cost the manufacturer 30 more cents have this piece of glass laminated for safety and security to prevent this and they cut corners. Thought you should know.

The process of rebuilding was virtually seamless. There was plenty of room for the PSU under the shroud, which helped eliminate some of the cable clutter. There was also ample room for cable management, which led to easy installation and removal of the back panel. I bought an extra case fan and mounted it above the pre-installed front fan to create positive pressure and ensure that my components were getting good enough airflow. The full mesh front panel definitely helped with that.

Good Cable Management
Comes with a couple of decent quiet fans
Reasonable Size
Rubber Grommets on the removable drive trays
Cons: A little tight gently lowering the motherboard in with the basement right next to it, but workable.
Could use a little more room in front of the PSU, some of the larger power cables took a little convincing to bend just right. I don't think it would be as bad if it was partially or non modular.
The tempered glass might be a little too smoked for some.
Overall Review: Great case, looks good, and while i initially thought the smoked glass was a little too dark, with some RGB lighting in there, it actually works really well.

Only comment was that in some places it's a little tight. I also had to relocate a case fan to fit my graphics card in, but that had a bonus of opening up some 120mm supports just beneath the graphics card, that I used to 3D print a card support to take the strain off the PCIE weight. So in that respect the dimensions allowed me to more easily support the card weight.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

It held my Aorus motherboard perfectly, had good space around the GPU, and the front panel worked perfectly.

There's a little bit of flexibility in mounting internal drives which is nice, and the finish work on that scene good I only had one issue with a cable that was rubbing on a sharp corner that I solved with a couple of pieces of electricians tape. It is out of sight in the black tape disappears when you apply it anyway.
Cons: The only minuses are these.

The front outer panel is held on by plastic clips which need to be handled with care. I had to use a flat blade screwdriver to take the front panel off very carefully but was able to do so without marring the finish.

The fit on the tempered glass panel is a bit less than perfect but works.
Overall Review: A great value with good finish work and good cable management. So far my system with four fans, using a Ryzen processor runs cool and quiet. I would cheerfully recommend this case.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: The power button and usb slots are next to each other on the top face of the case, and if your case is sitting on a desk then plugging in a usb device could potentially mean pressing the power button by accident if you aren't standing up to check. Minor issue though.
Overall Review: My last case was one with CD and HDD drive bays on the front and no cable management - super cramped and little airflow. And since CDs and hard drives are not as commonly used these days it was silly to restrict myself like that. Upgrading to this case was a dream come true. All the cables are nicely tucked away and my PC parts can breathe. If you're like me and still have a case from 2012 do yourself a favor.

- Small footprint (relatively)
- Tempered glass

- Great value for money
Cons: - Finnicky front plastic panel removal, but not too bad after 1-2 times.
- No optical/3.5'' drive slot
- Tempered glass just ""sits"" there while tightening it to the case with screws... you have to be vigilant so it doesn't accidentally fall and crack while putting it on.
Overall Review: This case is phenomenal... especially when it goes on sale. Very easy to build in. I was looking for a few things in this price range and when I saw FD, I knew it was the right one -- I wanted a PSU shroud, tempered glass, and somewhat compact and it checks all the boxes.

- sturdy
- very reasonable amount of room for cable management- I have cable extensions + an RGB controller, it gets pretty snug but still very doable
- you can see your RGB fans through the front mesh panel and the top mesh panel
- easily removable dust filters are great- before you lift the computer make sure you take out the bottom one before lifting from under the front intake, I almost dropped mine
Cons: -it is a little short front to back so if you're putting in a custom liquid loop you probably won't be able to fit a full size video card and reservoir BUT Fractal makes a ""stretch"" version called an S2 that you could 100% fit all your custom liquid stuff in- not really a con but something worth knowing

- AMAZING CABLE MANAGEMENT (switched from NZXT s340)
- SSD Mounts in the back help make the build look clean
- Very easy to route cables
- excellent air flow- 4 140mm fans and 1 120mm fan
- Great thumbscrews for Tempered Glass
Cons: Cons
- My Mobo (asus x470 f) VRMs are elevated enough to not allow me to mount mt NZXT X63 AIO at the top, and my RTX 2070 super would let me mount my AIO at the front (not enough space for gpu and bottom fan
So I cam currently running the AIO at the front with one fan lol

-Beautiful aesthetic
-Great Airflow
Cons: -Tempered glass side panel
Overall Review: I've had this case for nearly 2 years and love the way it looks and how easy it was to put my build together inside of it. It allows for an incredibly clean build with plenty of space and great cable management. Up until yesterday I would've given this a five star review. While taking the tempered glass side panel off to clean the inside it shattered in my hands. Shattered might be putting it kindly, it exploded everywhere inside my case and around my desk. The panel wasn't dropped, or in contact with anything besides my hands and I wasn't Hulk gripping it or anything out of the ordinary.

I started looking into getting a replacement panel, and while it seems this should be covered by warranty I found several other users in on Reddit post describing the same situation. I would buy another Fractal case because the ""pros"" are everything I'm looking for in a case.

The overall construction is solid and the case offers plenty of openings from the back through to the motherboard so that you don't need to run cables all over.

The SSD tray behind the motherboard is feature i also think every case maker should take into consideration! Literally spent maybe 5 minutes tidying up the backside of my build. Dust filters cover all the major points of interest and are easily accessible. Full length PSU shroud is also a nice touch. Oh, cant forget about tempered glass! Would recommend the no tint if you plan on gazing upon your build.
Cons: Not really a con just something to think about, If you remove the bottom HHD/SSD tray, the top cut out on the PSU shroud tends to have a bit of a rattle. Say you were making a flick on your mouse, you would hear the tinniest bit of rattle. Took me a minute to figure out where it was coming from. Once i did i put a very small piece of tape on the bottom of the cut out where it meets the rest of the shroud. That easy and it took care of it. Just something to keep in mind if you plan or removing that. If you don't have a need for the tray, it makes tucking your cables under the psu shroud that much easier.

I ended up doing 2 140mm in the front though, so it would stay completely covered at the bottom and it’s working great. So far no other cons. Honestly that may be true in most cases, I’m not positive.
Overall Review: I would definitely recommend this case and I would buy it again. It’s been great so far.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Big enough to work on from the inside
-Amazing for cable management
-foam on inside help keep fan sound quiet
-heavy glass panel, also helps with ""sound proofing""
Cons: -Wish there was a version with a flat front, I'm not sure how much the ""jagged"" front helps airflow.
Overall Review: Great case with only a personal con, hence why I'm not taking away a star. PSU spare cables can be hidden in the back neatly and looks great. airflow is great, very compact, I thought it was going to be much bigger.

It's a little on the heavy side since the glass panel is decently heavy (considering). Also the fans are great, usually these pre-installed fans are mediocre at best.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- PSU shroud provides an easy way to hide cables and HDDs if you have any; I can't imagine using a case without one, outside of SFF
- spots for mounting additional case fans or rails
- no RGB, which is what I was looking for in a case
- some fairly good cable management options provided
Cons: - it's a lightweight case, so it may not be as solid as other cases you may be considering; not a big deal to me
- I would recommend adding case fans, as it comes with two but supports up to 6
- you may need to check CPU cooler height (if using air cooling) and GPU length
- mine did not come with the bracket for mounting the PSU at the back of the case; ticket in with Fractal to see if I can get the part sent
Overall Review: Overall, I think I would recommend this case.

It's not as wide as some modern cases are (was looking for cases around 8-9 inches wide) and doesn't have RGB lighting on its provided fans or within the case, which is great for a straightforward, unobtrusive look. I find the case to have an interesting design, and the tinted glass side panel option provides a way to still show off your build regardless of if you go with RGB or not.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

I really can't suggest a solution as I'm sure these need to be separate for different MB configurations.

Rubber Grommets in wire management are a little generic. They have tendency to slide off grooved metal opening when adjusting cables. A better secured brush type grommet would probably be a cleaner look but would probably cost more.

Plenty of space to work with and easy to access everywhere you need to. Others have said enough, but this is an amazing case for the price.
Cons: It's a LITTLE tight behind the power supply where you store excess cabling. There's a hard drive bay down there that holds two standard HDDs and while this is all hidden behind the back panel, it is a little tight if you have a lot of thick power cables coming out of your PSU, but this case is pretty small so there's really nowhere else they could have added extra space.

Slight modular features, i did not use but nice to have.
Beautiful glass side panel that shows just enough but not to much.
Nice silent fans.
Cons: When trying to take a picture to show off the case the pristine glass panel acts like a mirror.
I would like the case to be just a bit taller to accommodate the top fans to be a little bit further away from the board.
Overall Review: It has been a couple of years since building a new PC and even more for buying a case. I am usually a Corsair fanboy but wanted to give this case a shot.

Overall I am greatly impressed with this case. It looks fantastic, pretty good cable management, and nice modular options if you wanted to use them. The only issues I had when installing everything was length of cables barely fitting or trying to reach in and get things plugged in with my larger hands. If I had a modular power supply and ordered some cables to length this would have been so easy I would have laughed.

Cons: I only have one real con and one that's not really a con, just something I wish I would have realized ahead of time.

Real Con: without removing the HDD cage there is very little room for to store the excess length of power supply cables.

Not a real Con but good to know:
If you front mount a 280mm aio, possibly also true with a 240mm (I used the Corsair H115i Platinum) the radiator is so close to the top of the case, the aio tubing blocks the installation of a second 120mm exhaust fan at the top of the case. My one top and one rear exhaust fan are keeping temps down just fine but now I have an extra Corsair LL fan that's just sitting in the box. Again, totally on me which is why I didn't dock any stars but I figured this piece of info may prevent someone making the same mistake I did.

This case has plenty of room for cable management.

This case has great airflow . I notice lower temps in Meshify series cases than other “high flow” cases .

The light tint tempered glass panel is just right to the case . The glass is dark enough to “hide” your cables that would usually be seen .

The front mesh filter can easily be removed for servicing . The whole front cover does not have to be removed.

This case know how to look great without tons of rgb .
Cons: This case comes with one rear 120mm exhaust fan . For the price of the case , this is acceptable. I would be willing to pay a few more dollars extra for both a intake and exhaust fan setup.

The top mesh filter feels a bit flimsy . Again , this directly correlates with the price and is completely fair.

-Room for 3 SSD and extra 3.5 HDD
-Fits my full size video Card with no issues.
-Upon finishing the move from my older case I was really happy with the looks and layout of my components it looked clean and tidy.
Plenty of case Fan Space and large CPU Fan heat sink.
Really liked the Tempered glass however... (read on)
Cons: I am not sure the tempered glass is tempered enough? mine chattered as i sat it onto its rubber grommet resting place and as I began to center it on the rubber spacers and as soon as it sat in place simply blew into a million pieces, that really sucked! I am not sure the quality of the ""Tempered Glass"" or if the tempering process was done right? Now I am out the glass cover i wonder how much that is ... that was a big disappointment.
Thee are no power LED on the top only a faint blue in the upper right hand side in front of teh case behind the front grid. I thought the power switch lit up but it does not.
Overall Review: Great design really good looking case for 100.
Not a great investment if your glass chatters with minimal interaction.
I was very very careful with this but certainly will not withstand minimal impact the only force I could imagine felt like it self collapsed in the middle and lost its Tempered state, it will not take much to blow into pieces. The mess Oh My Good! The MESS to clean it all out of the case and the MOBO was a nightmare. I hope i can find a Plexiglas or non glass cover replacement. this was so disappointing, glass breaks very easily and effortlessly.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: This was my first build and I chose this case for over all value and ratings. I had no problems with the case during the build. Everything about this case is good. I did have one issue with the Sata connections connecting an HDD and an SSD but that had more to do with the PSU cables not being long enough to reach both devices do to the distance between them. Luckily I had an extension. I really like that the screws for the side panel and the PSU brace do not come out fully, no way of loosing them.

Cons: - Being lightweight is nice, but result is very thin metal
- If using the drive bay, practically impossible to add modular PSU fittings later, so add before shoving PSU into case.
Overall Review: Great case. I have used 4 of them now, and with the drive bay removed, I can overlook the thin metal as the result is a lightweight case. I mount two 120mm led fans in front, replace the one in the rear with led, and add two 140mm leds to the top. Plenty of airflow and beautiful machine when running.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Tempered Glass Side
PSU Cover
Great Air Flow
Easy to install components
Cons: Tight working at top to install CPU Power Cable
Should've came with 3 case fans and not the two
Overall Review: Overall this case was easy to install my components in. I have only two negative reviews for this case.

1-Trying to route my CPU power cables to the top of the case was a bit troublesome, I guess if I had modular cables then it wouldn't be an issue, but my 4+4 was hardwired into my PSU. Thou, I'll be buying a modular one in the near future or some cable extension cables. Most likely a new PSU.

2-I wish the case came with a third case fan, so I would have two in the front and one in the rear. It only came with one in front and one in rear. I easily bought a third fan to place in the front.

It's not something I would subtract a star from, but overall this case looks great and the ability to show off the RGB with the tinted tempered glass is what makes this case stand out.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Thoughtful layout of cable ties, cable ports, and components placement.
- Good airflow, especially with two intake front-mounted fans.
- Clean Fractal Design look.
- Very quiet?
Cons: - Tempered glass panel screws might be hard to tighten if you have dexterity problems, they are hand screws with a very little amount of grip surface. Fractal Design should put a small detent so people can you coins of flathead screwdrivers to tighten them.
Overall Review: My first Fractal Design case was R4 in 2014. I always liked how FD designs simple and elegant cases, right angles, monochrome theme, nice little accents like chromed stands off, white trays. And Meshify C is not an exception.

Meshify C combines the best of Fractal Design - it is simple and elegant, has a well organized internal layout, with an excellent airflow of the case.

I built an air-cooled system for its low-maintenance and this case is a perfect choice for it. You can fit giant tower CPU cooler with low profile memory modules (Noctua D15 in my case), two 140mm front-mounted radiators, and full-sized GPU with triple fans.

It has well-though internal layout. I've never found myself thinking that I need another port for cable management or hooks to attach zip-ties. It comes with 3 velcro cable ties mounted on the rear panel near the front mesh so you can organize all your cables using them. The space behind the motherboard is enough to cable manage your thick PSU and fan cables.

Speaking about aesthetics, the full tempered glass panel looks very clean and beautiful. I went with a tinted glass version and if you don't have lights inside of your case and want to show off your internal components it will be a problem as it's very hard to see through without lighting. I put a white LED strip under the chassis side so the internal all well illuminated with white color for a clean (no RGB) look.

I had concerns about noise before buying this case, however, I barely can hear it when I'm lightly using the computer.

My main issue with the case was side panel screws which are hand-mounted and not that comfortable to screw them in, but probably won't be doing that very often...

Overall, this is a great case and would definitely recommend to anyone building a system with one GPU.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: None of these deserve an egg btw:
-I like the idea of the top dust filter being magnetic however it does slide around if you touch it. Would be nice to see some sort of locating pins on opposing sides so it doesn't slide.
-One of the thumbscrews for the back side panel was super tight and needed a pair of pliers to remove. Luckily nothing was stripped
-It didn't build itself??
Overall Review: The last computer I built was back in 2007-8 so I was worried that technology had surpassed my ""expertise"" in building a new rig with all of the features these cases have now. I was pleasantly surprised that it's even easier now and cable management techniques from case manufacturers (especially Fractal) have far surpassed anything I knew or dealt with in the past.

I browsed through hundreds of cases for this build ranging in price and size and I could not be happier that I chose this Meshify over all of them. 10/10 would buy again. But maybe in white this time :D",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Dark tint is honestly beautiful, especially if you've got lights inside.

-Relatively small! Without being hard to work in

-Simple design (I'm glad that the ""fractal"" pattern doesn't stand out in person)

-It collects VERY VERY little dust, especially compared to my previous case.
Cons: -I suppose if I must list a con, it would be the power button placement. My cat occasionally jumps on top and steps on the button, lol.

-It could be easier to open the side panel, but it's glass. They would have to change the appearance of the side in order to accommodate an ""easy open"" type panel. In 2 years, I've only opened it a handful of times, anyway.
Overall Review: I've owned this case for 2 years, and it looks as great as ever! I basically only see the lights inside this case due to the dark tint (unless I get really close and shine a light through the glass), and combined with the cable management, my case looks clean AF. There is virtually no cables sitting around inside or stretching across. They are all able to come out exactly where they need to.

Because of the lack of clutter, there is even less for dust to stick to AND I get better airflow. Seriously! I open this thing maybe once every few months (at MOST) and there's almost no dust! I have cats and dogs, pet hair piles up around the case on occasion, and still virtually nothing inside the case itself.

I've come from a beast of a Thermaltake Level 10 GT case that was just too large, dusty, and lacked good cable management. I knew I wanted something small while still being easy to work with, could fit an ATX mobo, and fit a large gpu. I've dealt with a single NZXT case and had a horrible experience and I wasn't quite ready to give them my time and money again, despite knowing their newer cases were popular and likely much improved.

This one seemed to fit my needs AND budget, despite never hearing of this brand. I took a big chance, and have been very pleasantly surprised. Even 2 years later, I haven't gotten tired of how awesome the tint looks with lights inside. I enjoy not having to see the components themselves.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

I needed a case with lots of airflow since my cave is in an attic like area where it is hot year around. Did not want to water cool and do all air. Temps are at highest around 60-65c no matter the length of play time and load I have running. And mind you that is in a 85 degree room that is hard to cool itself. The case has the best cable management I have had the pleasure to build in. Truly a grade A experience with a fairly low price tag. Do not hesitate to buy this, especially if it's on sale.
Cons: Maybe, not enough color options.

- Lots of nice grommets and tie downs
- Glad I got the light tinted glass
- Tonnes of airflow!
Cons: - Can get abit cramped up top if you plan on running 2x 140mm fans.
- Plan on getting cable extensions for your power lines if you wish to keep things neat up top!
- Front panel with the USB and Buttons makes things abit awkward when installing front fans. Make sure to leave some slack in the case for the wires on the front mesh panel.
- Glass side panel is abit awkward to work with.
Overall Review: Nothing really bad to say about it. Its well constructed and matches what is described about. Overall build is really good. Metal parts are nicely painted and solid feeling. Not thin or cheap feeling at all. This case can really flow nicely with some added fans. Cable management is pretty good overall.

The case is a very high-quality manufacture, I found no defects or other things that would put me off.
The drive tray is removable, a massive plus for me who has stopped using them.
Cable management is excellent, the space to keep them and the built-in velcro ties are very helpful.
Case airflow is the main reason I purchased this, it is quite frankly excellent, and also dust resistant.
The side glass panel is very easy to remove and looks nice.
The case is raised high enough that the power supply can draw air from the bottom of the case.
Top dust cover is secured with magnets, pretty easy to move, take off, no problems.
Cons: Front I/O is attached to the case front section, making it a bit annoying when wanting to remove the power supply shield cover for maximum airflow.
The front mesh/foam dust protector is secured using a plastic clip at the bottom, it's a bit fiddly to open up but feels like it will break if opened too often or with too much force.
Power supply shroud (the basement) cannot be fully removed, only a panel by the front fans can open up, this isn't really a big problem but it would make building a little bit easier if I could just pop it out when needed.
Overall Review: A great case for all purposes. I wanted to get something that would last me a long-time, look good, have great airflow and cable management, and I got all of that with this!

Wide enough to fit a long GFX card
HDD cage can be removed if not used
Alternate HDD mounting point if you have just one HDD
Backside mount for SSDs (only three)
Removable PSU shroud plates
ALL intakes have a removable filter or screen that can be cleaned
Extremely quiet stock fans
Cons: Top screen is magnetically mounted and is easily moved if you aren't careful. Not a big issue, but it is something to be cautious about.

Long PSUs require the removal of the HDD cage for wire management and remove the option to mount the single HDD (where the HDD cage is originally).

Power and reset buttons are right next to commonly accessed USB and audio top-side ports and can easily be accidentally pushed (this has happened at least 2 times so far)

Would have appreciated rubber grommets for the PSU face plate. The face plate isn't guaranteed to be exactly flush with the PSU and some constant vibrating hum noise occurs.

No optical drive mounting option (if you were looking to keep one)

No vertical mount for GFX card (I wasn't looking for one, but it wasn't immediately obvious from the product description)
Overall Review: This is case was amazing to work with. The cabling options were awesome in terms of routing and hiding the mess so the case looks clean and professional.

Air cooling a RTX 2080 SUPER FTW3 with the stock case fans and haven't had an issue with heat yet.

- Lots of space for whatever you’re trying to put into it (I use RTX 2060 Super so it fit)
- Motherboard stand off has a support pin in the middle as with other holes for other sides.
- Velcro ties on the side helped manage
- USB 3.0 is always fit with my motherboard that supported 3.0
- Great for airflow
Cons: - The 2 stock fans might not cover all your airflow (I used mine as rear and top rear exhaust fans)
Overall Review: Overall really happy with this case. I only have a couple of RGB items such as RAM, a small logo on the MOBO, and 2 LED fans on the front. But wow, the mesh on the front is great for showing off that fan LED color and the tempered glass side panel shows off a good amount of light that won’t distract you if you have it next to you while gaming. Airflow was perfect after I calibrated my fans and used the 2 stock fans from the case as my exhaust fans - They are quiet!

Love the easy magnetic mesh to clean up any dust/fluff that gets stuck on there! I also love that I can see all my glowy components on the side window!
No issues with the case getting hot whatsoever. I have 3 RGB corsair fans (120mm) and the two that came with the case (one in the back I left as is, moved the one from the front to the top back, although that one I currently have it turned off since I do need more extenders or w/e to connect it).
The Headphone jack is a 3 ring which is great so I can use my phone headphones or my gaming headset that has a 3-ring plug! Reset button in the front as well and 2x 3.0 USB ports in the front makes it super convenient for me! The power light isn't super bright (a blue soft light in the top right corner behind the black front metal mesh) which is great since it doesn't take away from the RGB fans I put in and it's not shining up to my face like other PCs in the past!
Cons: Fans that are included are okay. They aren't the best quality, but they do what they need to do. The screws for mounting more fans aren't that great though (they got all worn out just setting my fans up in the case).
I had to take out the metal case that holds the two extra HDD/SDD on the bottom in order to fit in all 3 of my fans in the front, but I made it work so that's all that matters!
The battery sits on the bottom back of the case, and if you don't have it somewhat elevated off the floor, that may be an issue. Just don't place it on carpet, I have my case on an elevated metal grid platform that's attached to and below my desk. It has 4 legs on the bottom but it only gives a few inches of space for air to flow, which is not bad if on a flat, smooth surface that is not heat conducive.
The case is a tad heavy for me to lift and put it at my desk with my back issues, but I have my husband to do that for me. If you are not able-bodied and live alone, I would probably not recommend it, but I don't really move it unless I'm adding more components or attaching things in the back and that's usually once and then I don't touch it for a long time, so I don't see this as a big issue, just a precaution for those who do live alone or have no means of asking someone for help!
Overall Review: I would definitely recommend this to others if they are building a case for the first time, since for the price and the quality it's not that bad. I can see this case lasting me at least 5-7 years maybe more since I take good care of my electronics. There is plenty of space if i want to add water cooling to the top, but the way that this case is built, I really don't see a reason to add it because it does not get hot at all! I love the look! Sleek, very clean, and the metal mesh in the front looks super cool with my rgb fans glowing through! Worth it for my first ever build :)",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Older Review: Great case overall, although the Front screen had some blemishes on it. After taking a closer look, the paint bubbled up somehow and there is rust underneath. Not sure if this came out of the factory like this or if it was stored improperly.

Now, this is very minuscule, and it won't impact any performance, however I get disappointed when a spend a good amount of money on something and there is avoidable damage that I did not cause.

- smoked glass side panel is good if you want to see RGB lighting
- pretty good access
- important screws are cleverly designed so they can be undone without falling out of their hole - you can't drop or lose them
Cons: - with the open front and top, and my 12-core Ryzen 9 using its stock fan, it's slightly annoyingly loud
- all the black mesh finishes need a fair bit of dusting

Overall Review: I highly recommend this case. I transferred my existing rig from a Thermaltake Core V21, which I purchased in early March from Micro Center. It was a excellent modular microATX case which got a good two months of use. However, it was taking up too much room on my desk, and the acrylic panel scratched easily. I also missed the tower form factor. It was a nice little experiment though, and was always going to be a holdover until the Meshify C Mini came back in stock and waiting on a promo sale.

Easy accessibility and good size. Unfortunately it has many shortcomings.

Very water-cooling compatible, looking forward to building a loop in it when I have the time and money.
Cons: Since the glass side panel is only held by 4 screws it can be tricky to remove and replace it without fear of dropping it or getting fingerprints everywhere.
If you have 3.5 inch drives the hard drive bay can be in the way of large from radiators and eats into cable management space if you have a lot of PSU cables to hide.

- Clever ways to help keep the PC install looking clean to take advantage of that glass door
- Two decent fans
- Lots of options for watercooling configuration
- Plenty of cable length for FP connections
- Sturdy enough to survive a shipping fiasco (see below)
Cons: - The front panel CANNOT have an H60 radiator in the ""top slot"". It will block the wiring harness for the front panel and prevent it from being clipped back into place. Also, to that note, if using a modern GPU that takes up every bit of space in a mid-tower, you won't be able to fit the case fan on the bottom slot. Had to reconfigure a couple times to get it right with the H60 cooler being a top-exhaust of the case and the case fan blowing in from top-middle of the front panel. Nothing drastic, but I was annoyed enough to lose a half-star over it.
Overall Review: Overall I'd absolutely use this case again for another customer build. This was my first Fractal case and I was overall pleased with it. I assembled the PC and put it back into its original packaging for shipping to customer, and in transit the box got crushed pretty severely. Enough to bend the back panel of the case in quite a few degrees. If not for the hefty RTX 2070 GPU I'm pretty sure the system would have been severly damaged. I think the case did its best and miraculously the glass door didn't break or crack despite the odd pressure it must have had on it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: - Won't work without a modular PSU unless you don't use HDDs
- Some graphics cards simply don't have enough clearance to fit in it
- Glass panel is mounted with screw-ports instead of being hinged or sliding in
Overall Review: This case is much smaller than the Corsair case I used before. Just to clarify, the first 2 cons don't apply to my situation, but I thought of them after the fact of putting everything together: I just barely had enough space to fit my cables using a fully modular PSU and filling the HDD rack, and my graphics card (a GTX 1080) barely fit with maybe a millimeter or two between it and the front fan. This case is gorgeously simplistic and compact at a great price, but you definitely need to make sure it's right for you before purchasing because it definitely isn't a ""one-size-fits-all"" type of case.

Also, it's important to plan out your cable management ahead of time with this case. Some cables can fit through the appropriate slots in the PSU shroud but not after you've already mounted the motherboard.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Amazing airflow
- really easy to build in
Cons: - the front panel is sort of tricket to take off the first time
- wish the mATX version came in white
- stock fans that come with case are loud at stock fan settings
Overall Review: I really like this case. This is my first mATX build and this case made it incredibly easy to build in. Barely noticed a difference between this and my older full ATX build. As many of the other reviews state, the airflow in this thing is amazing. Only major con I have is that the stock fans that came with the case are pretty loud at stock settings. If you set the fan curve to ""silent"" (as I did via the BIOS on my motherboard), the noise is more tolerable. I anticipated this and replaced them with Noctua fans, but something to think about if you're not planning on installing 3rd party fans.

The tinted side glass panel looks great. I really love the method they used for installation and attachment of the tempered glass against the chassis. Elegant and safe, with an inability to overtighten the screws, so no chances of cracking the glass. Cable management was fine in this case, nothing too special. As some reviewers have mentioned, if you're not using the HDD cage, you can take that out and then cable management is even easier.

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Christopher T.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,2/2/20 14:07,5.0,"Overall Review: It’s been over half a decade since I upgraded my computer and I have to say case designs have come a long way. There’s so many subtle changes that make the PC building process and the end result more satisfying. I was never big on the aesthetics of my case but still I knew my unorganized mess of cables affected the air flow and could lead to more issues. Having the cables slip in through small ports on the back saved me that trouble. Dust was another constant problem for me because my system was such a cluster f***. The way this case is designed it will mitigate the issue.

The ability to mount SSD to the back plate behind the motherboard was a convenient touch. The two stock fans are very quiet and you can hardly hear them going. Plus the ability to add several more was a crucial selling point for me. I could go on and on about this case but I’ll spare you the time and just say that overall it has a simple elegance and if you want function over flashy looks you can’t go wrong with this case!",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,0,0,1

- I've taken the glass panel off several times and it's really not as sketchy as I would have thought. In fact, it's almost satisfying.
- The darkness of the tint hides things you don't really care about and brings focus to your lighting.
- The PSU bay design is so much better than any previous case I've used. It did confuse me for a second (because I definitely don't read instructions, but definitely should), but I love it.
- The removable filters are simple and effective.
- It just FEELS like a quality case.
Cons: - If you're installing three fans on the front panel, you'll need to remove a cover for the bottom bay area (meant for the PSU). That makes wires harder to hide, but it's not that big of a deal.
- Installing a water-cooler on the top is pretty easy, but make sure you have all your wires facing in the desired direction, otherwise you'll have to remove the radiator to rotate them because space is kinda tight.
- Overly tightening the panel screws (even by hand) can make it *really* hard to unscrew them later. Just don't screw them on too tight. It's not going anywhere.
Overall Review: Don't sleep on it. This case is a great bargain for the price. If you have the money, you're going to get something you're proud to own.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- The front panel, with the abstract designs, are actually abstract to the touch. It's not a visual illusion. You can feel the bumps from the design. Very cool in my opinion.
Cons: - The only thing I'm not sure of, and is why I'm writing this con, is I'm not sure if there's a thickness standard to case fans. The removable front piece of the PSU shroud didn't give me enough room to mount my third 120mm fan at the very bottom. I bought 3 fans for the front of this case, removed the shroud section, and the fan wouldn't fit. Just something to keep in mind if there is some thickness standards with case fans and AIO's.

Glad to hear you like the case! Regarding your experience installing 120mm fans in the front, there should be enough room for three of them. You may need to remove the middle fan first to let the bottom-most fan slide into that slot in the PSU shroud. If you'd like further assistance, we'd be glad to offer our help.

Very nice to look at. Stylish but clean aesthetics. Many options for fans/radiators to create excellent air flow. The front panel design has baffles that cut down on fan noise. Sufficient room between motherboard tray and side panel and lots of egress to allow for good cable management. Quality dust filters. There was enough front to back room to allow me to install push/pull fans on my AIO liquid cooler radiator using a Sapphire Rx580 Nitro plus video card but a longer card would not have permitted this.

System: Ryzen 2700x/MSI B450i Gaming Plus AC/EVGA G2 650 watt modular PSU/Saphire Rx 580 Nitro Plus GPU/Coolermaster 240 AIO liquid cooler with push-pull fans.
Cons: None to speak of. PSU is a tight fit and as others have noted, it might be a challenge to store unused cables it you're not using a modular PSU as the space between the front of the PSU and the drive cage is pretty limited.
Overall Review: I think this case finds the perfect balance between compactness and roominess. Over the years, I have swung between the two extremes of full tower roominess and the small footprint of the mini ITX format but find both have their drawbacks. This Meshify C Mini seems to strike the perfect balance between the two for me. I am currently populating it with a mini ITX motherboard but I like the fact that I can move up to a mATX motherboard in the future if I want.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Great default fan placement.

Awesome hole placement for cable managing, in every place where a cable could need to pass.
Cons: The space between the inside of the case and the back panel is tight, making cable management a bit harder.

Great airflow. I moved the stock provided fan to top exhaust and added 2 140mm corsair fans to the front and am getting slightly lower than average temps on my ryzen 7 3700x with stock wraith cooler

Cons: I will nitpick a bit here. Front screen is very difficult to remove. On first try I was worried I would break it. After doing it once it's not so scary. I however couldn't get the front trim piece removed. This made installing the larger 140mm fans very difficult as they were right up against the trim piece.

I replaced the single front 120mm fan with 2 140mm fans. With fans at 100% it will of course be quite loud. However, I discovered that even running the front fans at around 50% and leaving the cpu/back fan on a curve still got me cooler temps and lower noise then my previous corsair 200r.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Power supply has its own built in area. When you attach the supplied, power supply face plate, the power supply can be slid out of its compartment, to add or remove module wires to the supply. Metal of the case is not flimsy. Black paint of the case, is painted very well.There are plenty of tie down anchors to create very neat wiring, between the wall of the motherboard and side door of the case. The case has top, bottom, and front fine dust screens. The case is light and compact, compared to other Md-tower cases.
Cons: No cons, other than, there are no Front Drive bays for DVD or CD drives. (That helps make the case more compact.) I don't use them hardly at all, anyway. You can always attach an external USB, DVD drive to install Windows or play music etc.
Overall Review: I recommend this case, for builders that like to wire, mostly outside of the case in between the walls, and for great air flow inside of the case.

- Looks beautiful
- Great cable management

- Very quiet w/ aftermarket fans considering the open front/mesh design
Cons: - LOUD.. with stock fans and stock AIO fans (around 15 dB difference when replaced)
- Front Panel IO/Hub connected to case meaning the front panel will not completely remove when installing front fans/AIO
Overall Review: I'm absolutely loving this case! Once I replaced the stock fans with the Corsair ML120 Pros and the stock Kraken X60s with Noctuas this case dropped about 15 dB.. I'm very pleased with how this build, my first, turned out. Plenty of room for cable management. The Velcro and zip tie cut outs made keeping the back of the case clean.

It was very easy to work with and accepted a full-sized motherboard (Gigabyte Aorus Pro) and ridiculously-sized Noctuna NH-D15 CPU cooler with room to spare. I bought this as for a total upgrade for my son (all new parts) and it was a delight (no kidding) to show him how a full PC build should go, with no issues. I was really concerned the D15 might not fit, but it had plenty of clearance from the glass panel.

Love how compact it is but still fits a 360 radiator and huge video card.. I can go on and on about how much I love the case. It's a case that's not in your face but so sweet,looks smooth and with so much air flow.

- The design of the case behind the motherboard has plenty of room for installing a backplate for your cooler. The wire management potential and the result of my build was excellent.

- The included magnetic dust filters are placed well, and should keep dust maintenance down to once a year.

- I would build in this case again. You should add two additional 120mm fans to this case. One more for the front, and one for the top near the CPU cooler for the best load temperatures.
Cons: - You must be careful when pulling off the front panel to install additional front fans. It's possible to install a fan without disconnecting the connected front I/O wires and removing the panel completely, but you have to be mindful of the force you're using to pull the panel off initially, or you could do some damage to the circuit board, the wiring, or both.

I did no damage to my unit because I scouted these connections, but it should still be mentioned because there was no special mention in the manual.

- Removing the hard drive cage within the power supply shroud was a little more difficult than it needed to be, but it's mostly my fault for not getting a fully modular power supply for such a small case.
Overall Review: The finished build in this case was excellent on temperatures. With ambient temperatures ranging from 55F - 71F over 5 days:

A Ryzen 5 2600 was taken to 3.95GHz on all cores @ 1.325v stable over 2 hours of Prime95 with a stream and discord running during the torture test, without input lag and a maximum CPU temp of 66C . Gaming load temps were between 42C and 48C on average.

The GPU was never in danger of heating up beyond 64C with the fans at 60% under load while gaming.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: No USB 3.2 front panel ports and one of the front panel USB 3.1 ports came damaged and bent. I was able to bend it back a little resulting in a functional port but it tends to leave connected peripherals very loose in the port. Not a big deal but annoying nonetheless.
Overall Review: I would highly recommend this case if you're looking for a lower priced mid tower with maximum airflow due to the open design and mesh front panel.

Rubber pads on the glass side panel screws and hard drive cage to avoid noise from vibrations.
Cons: Not really a con, but make sure you have enough clearance for your power supply; max psu depth is 175mm. I thankfully managed to fit my old 180mm psu in there with the hard drive cage still installed, but there is almost no room for the cables. Definitely something I should have checked on.

-Good cable management care and support
-Very good cooling support both air and water
-Stunning design


The cable management was clearly thought of when they designed this case, the included hardware was more than sufficient, and the build was fun and easy. As well the superb quality and design of the build there is also the look of the build. Fractal has really blown it out if the water here as far as aesthetics go. Very sleek elegant design classy enough to set on any desk but unique enough to let people know this isn't your average PC inside.
Cons: TLDR;
-Cheap feeling top dust filter
-Need to remove whole front of PC USB ports audio and all to clean the dust filter
-Not very quiet air cooled


The top dust filter does feel kind of cheap and weird I wish it was a more static solid piece or a sheet that slides out similar to the bottom.
Not very noise isolating, the fans in this case are the same ones in my other case, same build and this one is noticably louder than the other, however it's not a large difference it is a difference.

It does seem odd giving love to a computer case, but it is warranted. No aluminum thin pop can metal used, this case is extremely well built. It comes with two large fans, plus four filtered intake panels to ensure that everything inside stays cool and as dust free as possible. There are two USB ports on the top of the case (different than the front on most other cases I've dealt with) beside audio inputs and output jacks and the power switch. The glass pane on the one side (not really a fan, but I'm old school) uses thick Plexiglas and is very durable. 5 out of 5 eggs. Will be buying another for my next build.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,0,1

-Compact design but doesn't sacrifice too much function (Larger graphics cards may not fit)
-Tinted glass is amazing IMO
-Massive front airflow with lots of options for fan configuration with 120 or 140 mm fans

-As per usually with fractal design, cable management is a dream
Cons: Cons:
-Thumb screws for the glass are a bit slim. Can be difficult to grab them w/o getting smudges on your glass
-Compact design may limit larger graphics cards

Other than that, there isn't much more to say. I'm in love with this case... Although the S2 is catching my eye

Cable management is AMAZING
Build quality is solid
Mesh cover on top is magnetic, for easy removal and cleaning
Mesh ""drawer"" on the bottom slides out easily for cleaning
Cons: Can't use the bottom fan AND a 3.5"" drive (alone or with the drive bay). Drive bay must be removed in order to add the fan
Overall Review: It may be because this is my first good case (vs the budget cases I've only ever gotten before) but this case is amazing and completely worth every penny! I went with the no window version because I wasn't planning on running any lights but the window version would have been really cool to have given how clean and open this case is. The cable management is wonderful and EVERYTHING tucks along the back. Fan cables are run along the back and poke through right by their motherboard plug. Hard drive connectors are set to come out right next to their spot. It's really a thing of beauty having everything hooked up and out of the way because there are so few cables visible. The airflow is fantastic because of that and even after longer gaming sessions, the heat venting from the top (with 2 140mm fans) is barely warmer than room temp.

The only complaint I had was that it wasn't clear anywhere in the description or pictures how the fan placement worked within the case in regards to the drive bay. Underneath the PSU shield is a removable 3.5"" drive bay that can fit two drives. There's also the option to take that out and just mount a single 3.5"" drive along the bottom of the case. Unfortunately, having either the drive bay or a single drive in place means you can't use a 120mm fan there at all. This isn't a dealbreaker and the SSD mounts along the backside easily hold up to 3 drives there so there's plenty of space for drives, but if you have a 3.5"" drive you're planning on using for the main drive or storage, you won't be able to use that fan.

This is a wonderful case and I highly recommend this over any budget case you may be tempted to buy. The cable management alone is worth the extra cost and you will be so much happier being able to skip the zip ties for everything!",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Amazing cable management options
Cons: Small hardware conflict! (read below)
Overall Review: I LOVE this case. My previous case was larger and had those unneeded hard drive bays filling the front. The size allowed me to turn the pc sideways on my desk, so I can see all the hardware I had put into it.

My only issue with the case was that my current ram (Corsair Vengeance rgb) did not have easy clearance with a top mounted radiator setup. I went with a front mounted radiator to compensate, so if you'd like the previous option, would recommend a ram stick with a shorter profile",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Small enough to fit on my desk yet big enough to accommodate a full size gpu and cpu cool no issues
Cons: I only have one issue and it is purely cosmetic the front panel is made of plastic vs the rest of the case being metal. So if you get this case in white the plastic front cover is a flatter shade of white than the rest of the case

cable management was a breeze due to both the great layout of the case and with the use of the included zipties.
USB 3.0 on the front panel
Very high quality feel to the case, and very easy to build in
Cons: I don't think the front panel can be removed without disconnecting the front panel connectors on the motherboard, though I haven't tested this yet. They seem to be attached to the front, thus making it harder to add additional case fans to the front in the future, though I haven't tested to see if this is true or not, which is why I am not removing an egg.

Easy build.

Cons: 3.5 drive bay was tucked in the bottom where I had to put the PSU and its cables. I was unable to find reasonable spot for the 3.5 inch drive I needed to continue using until I have M.2 squared away. It's sitting in there on a pile of cables.
Overall Review: This was awesome. The 2.5 inch drives attach to a tray on the other side behind the motherboard. They are snug and perfectly stowed over there. There is a lot of room to work and cable routing is sweet. I'd buy it again, but with the glass side. The all metal one is great...I'd just prefer to see my build.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

The window allows an easy view of the inside and your components while hiding the wiring. The filters are also a great feature.
Cons: The front has space for three fans, however you have to remove a door to get the lower fan in and this also forces you to move the HDD cage back. I ended up modifying the door with a cutting wheel to get the clean look, but yet have the three fans installed in the front. I had to move the HDD cage back, and that is easy to do. However if you move the HDD cage back you wont have enough room for a large PSU. I wish there was a little more room for the PSU, but it is what it is. I modified my original plan for a larger PSU, and I will have to mount 2.5"" drives into the case up behind the CPU to make up for loosing the lower HDD cage due to cable room required. Something to be aware of!
Overall Review: I would prefer the case to be two inches longer for more PSU room and the HDD cage with a fan partially below. Overall still love the case and its look.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: This case is awesome. Period.

So much so I have built my third X299 mATX system using this Meshify Mini case. Wire management is just about perfect with the ASRock mATX X299 mobo's I'm using. Every wire is mostly hidden and makes the setup look super clean. My only complaint is that I couldn't fit another pair of 140mm fans on the front to push air into the radiator. The holes are offset enough that when I install the fans you can't get the mesh/filter front panel snapped back into place. Would have been perfect if there was just a slight bit more room between the plastic front panel and the cases sheet metal so you could fit the case fans. Maybe with some modifications it would fit, but I didn't try. So I'm left with just a pair of pull fans sitting on the radiator inside the case. Which is doing a great job of cooling so far. One other slight issue was that the magnet strips on the top mesh filter were attached right where the screws go when mounting top fans. So the filter didn't sit as flush as I would like. It was easy enough to just pull the adhesive backed strips off and relocate. But I just thought I would mention that.

One of the cases came with an intermittent USB problem on the top panel. Fractal Design CS quickly sent me a replacement and I was good to go. Excellent customer service. It was quick and painless.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Extremely good fit with Full ATX MB ( ASROCK B365 PRO4 )
- Interior is very well designed, everything is easy to get to and in the right place
- Air flow is great. Came with one fan in front and one in rear. The built in cable routing, placement openings and cable
straps keep all cabling out of the air flow path.
- Unique SSD drive mounting bracket accessible from the back allows you room for 3 more 2.5"" drives in addition to the
drive bay
- built in air filters are easy to pull and clean. Keeps dust out. Even the top is a removable mesh screen for added ventilation
- Bottom mounted PSU
- No wasted space anywhere, yet everything is easily accessible, no crowding anywhere
- The built in fans are quiet as a mouse
- Price. I feel like this case is a real bargain - well worth the price here
Cons: - I have not found any yet. Have had the case for 6 weeks now and have found nothing about it that I don't like.
Overall Review: - I bought this case as part of a new computer build for my home / home office to replace an aging Core2-duo that I built in 2009. I used the ASROCK B365 Pro4 full size ATX Motherboard and EVGA SuperNOVA 850 G+ PSU and the Core i7-8700 with the stock cooler and fan. The only way you can tell if the computer is running or not is by the blue LED in the upper right corner of the case. I've never had a computer that runs so quiet.

I am extremely well pleased with this case and I would highly recommend this case to anyone that is wanting to build a new desktop or gaming computer.",0.0,0.0,0.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Amazing air flow
-Sleek and gorgeous design
-Has dust filters
Cons: -Mesh atop of the case is a little ""wonky"". Magnets that keep it attached, are not good quality.
-Front case filter is a little hard to get to or you feel like you're going to break something. It's just a feeling as of right now, meaning the several times I've taken the face-plate off, nothing bad has happened. But I feel they could have possibly designed that a little better.
Overall Review: -I HIGHLY recommend this product to others. If you're in the market for a case that's not too big and not too small yet posses the necessary room for [almost] anything you want to add, then this case is for you.

Plenty of room for a beefy air cooler

No choking area for fans as the front is mesh
Room for a 240mm rad and a 360mm rad in the front
You can fit large PSU's in this case, as long as you move the HHD cages
You have to move the cover that's in front of the case for the 360 rad

- Great cable management
- Multiple areas for radiators
- Great airflow design
Cons: none
Overall Review: I use 3 120mm fans in the front and 1 for exhaust and that set up works great for me. Inside the temps are pretty low. I might switch to 2 140mm fans in the front but it's not a priority at the moment. This set up creates positive air pressure which should help keep dust out. I can barely hear the fans in the case and I'm using the 2 that the case comes with. If fan noise is a concern, most motherboards these days allow you to set the speed for each fan connected to it from the BIOS or through software. Like other reviewers mention, check the length of your video card to make sure it fits. Case specs say a max of 315mm with front fan installed. My Gigabyte RTX 2070 is 280mm so there's just a little bit of room. If you need more room, you won't be able to use a middle intake fan. Overall, this is an amazing case.

Quiet, seems to have great airflow. Cable management is easy. I like the 2.5 drive bay in the back panel. Not bad to work it, seems to fit most GPUs and I believe that it has space for most coolers. Comes with a center standoff that makes motherboard installation easy. Very nice looking.
Cons: It's a bit difficult to work in if you've got even average-sized hands. Probably need a screw starter to make life easier. Some stiffer power supply cables are difficult to route. Case doesn't have a front IO for a POST speaker - which wouldn't be an issue if your motherboard has one. Mine didn't, and coupled with my monitor not displaying the BIOS initially until it had something to boot to and I got my GPU Drivers installed, I thought I had messed up my build. It's something to keep in mind.

Front USBs can be a bit tight. I've gotten the wireless mouse dongle stuck in there, and it takes some effort and a paper shim to get it loose.
Overall Review: Overall, I really like the case. I wish it had a POST speaker and some stiffer cables have issues being routed correctly. I needed to route a lot of them through the same path, and it got a bit cramped. You need to connect all of the modular PSU cables before installing, because it's borderline impossible to do it when it's in.

However, these are all small issues that I just wish I knew before building in it. It's a very good case. Comes with two fans and has plenty of airflow. None of my components have gotten over 50 degrees C. Definitely recommend it, just be aware that it's a bit snug.",1.0,3.0,6.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-The dark panel makes RGB and LED lights visible but not overbearing.
-The intigrated Velcro straps are a god sent.
-3 mesh filters that are easily maintainable.
-Simple but very effective design
Cons: Not a lot of cons here but I do have a gripe.
-The ports for me at least are a pain to work with. I knew this going in however I looked at the pictures, and I’m a first time builder. Someone with a little more experience than myself wont have any problem building in this case.
-Make sure your power supply cords are long enough, they have to wrap around the top for CPU if they’re not long enough.
Overall Review: The gripes I have are more than likely my own fault for being new and over looking my power supplies cord length. It works but I had to kink the CPU cord into the motherboard which I’m not a fan of. Regardless I still give this case a 5/5, great value, great design and great ingenuity.

The case should come with the TG panel preinstalled using four bolts, one at each corner, and no other screws should be necessarily or included separately for this purpose. All Meshify C cases do have two screw holes on the right hand side of the chassis rear, but these are not used on tempered glass versions.

- Plenty of locations to put fans (three in the front, one in back, two on top, and one on the bottom). Currently, I have three fans in front for intake and one fan each in the back and on the top for exhaust.
- There is quite a bit of clearance on the side panel, which helps with cabling. As it stands right now, the only plainly visible cable in my case is the PCI-E cable powering my GPU. Everything else is mostly hidden out of sight.
- Dust covers, everywhere. At least in the places that matter (the bottom, top, and front of the case). The top and bottom covers are easy to remove and clean; the front cover... not so much.
- The glass side panel, like many glass panels, is sexy af. The mesh front panel has a nice design to it as well.
Cons: Some minor nitpicks:
- From where I have my rig placed, it's difficult to see the LEDs through the mesh front (fans, power/HDD indicator).
- The mesh cover is a little tricky to pop off without removing the entire front panel.
- If you have fans or a radiator mounted in the front, bigger video cards may not fit. Something to consider if you have or plan to get a long card like MSI's Duke or Zotac's Amp Extreme.
- The compact design may make liquid cooling a little tricky to fit in, at least with a custom loop.
- Some extra USB 2.0 ports would have been nice.
Overall Review: Coming from the larger Rosewill Blackhawk case, it felt a little awkward working with a smaller case. However, I had no problems putting all the components from my old case (minus the Blu-ray drive, of course) into the Meshify C. The extra space behind the motherboard side panel was very welcome, giving me more headroom for cabling as well as space to tuck a fan hub. With all my components installed, it's very spacious. Minor quibbles aside, it's a very solid case. Definitely recommended.",0.0,1.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: Not a problem for me, but if you wan to use a top mounted radiator, this is a no-go. The gap between the top of the case and the edge of the MB is barely bigger than my fans. No way you are getting most radiators in there as well.

Fits my 8700k and 1080ti build just fine and neither CPU nor CPU goes above 65 C under load with an air-cooled card.

Cable management on the backside is good.

Lightweight and compact. Might have some issues with a front mounted AIO and graphics card clearance, though. my EVGA SC Black 1080 ti almost touches my radiator, but it all fits together, regardless.

The case is very utilitarian in its design and there are no excessive plastic panels/attachments on the outside of the steel frame aside from the front panel.
Cons: Top-mounted AIO's might have some issues with clearance depending on the ram you use. Would recommend using low-profile ram if you intend to top-mount a 240 radiator.

Tempered glass mounting mechanism is a little outdated, but is sill functional and elegant.
Overall Review: Power supply shroud does choke GPU airflow a little bit, but opening the little door at the top of the shroud at the front of the case lets you mount a fan on the bottom and a fan at the front/bottom to blow air directly under the GPU.

Due to how much ventilation there is, there isn't too much in the way of sound dampening, so you'll hear your graphics card pretty well as it ramps.",0.0,1.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: I simply cannot give this 5 eggs, even though I would in a heartbeat. The main issue I have with this case is one of the mounts for the tempered glass side panel seems to be loose/rickety. With all of the thumb screws completely threaded in the case makes this obnoxious fast paced clicking sound that is reminiscent of a case fan having an obstruction. I have added no additional fans besides the ones that are on there stock. I have to unscrew one of the corners of the glass panel to get this clicking noise to stop. The noise stops when I press firmly against the corner of the panel. I tried actually looking inside the case to see if I could get a better idea of what is causing the noise, but it seems like it's rock solid. Maybe the thread pitch on one of the thumb screws isn't correct and causes it to vibrate once threaded in. I'm at a loss now.

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Anonymous,Ownership: 1 month to 1 year,Verified Owner,9/25/17 12:47,4.0,"Pros: Well laid out drive mounting positions. Decent options for single AIO configurations in a compact case.
Cable management options are okay
Cons: No filter for rear fan to be used as an inlet.
Good for CPU OR Video Card AIO solutions. Not both.
A bit narrow for an AIO cooler and some Z370 mother boards if you mount at the top
Too narrow and a little shallow for full sized ATX motherboards that have ports that stick straight out, towards the edge of the board. You will put stress on the ports if they cable housing hits the elongated openings for the wire management on the right.
Overall Review: Would recommend for CPU AIO solutions only if you don't want things to be too tight.
Really not pleased with how dark the glass panel is.
Running an MSI Seahawk AIO cooled 1080ti and H115i. With the rear fan not having a filter, I had to rig up the mounting for the GPU cooler to fit on the top. Not ideal as I am now exhausting hot air from the H115i into the path of the GPU radiator, and trying to draw it out the back.",0.0,1.0,2.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-functional airflow
-tempered glass
Cons: -front panel vibrate very loudly at times when 3.5 inch bays are populated.
-had to remove the filter to avoid the annoying noise
Overall Review: This is my 2nd fractal case which has extreme humming/buzzing with all the 3.5 slots populated. Really wish companies would provide better 3.5 inch mounting/padding to avoid this. My Fractal Define S also hums extremely loudly from the front panel as well when 3.5 inch drives are installed.",0.0,6.0,17.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1
Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Aaron M.,Ownership: 1 day to 1 week,Verified Owner,7/8/18 14:08,3.0,"Pros: Fits a full size ATX. Front of case is pulled back to meet the motherboard, nice and minimal in its design. The tinted glass works well with RGB motherboards as they tend to be very bright without the tint. Small footprint, great for the desktop. Cable management is generous. Full mesh front allows maximum airflow, but you can also see your RGB motherboard through it, very different. Has a ton of fan options. Power supply garage fits long options (must ditch the drive bays though). Triangulated front mesh is a first and looks really cool. Has an easy power led adapter that makes it easy to wire.
Cons: Don't hate!
- Still comes with 3.5 and 2.5 inch drive holders, threw mine away. Motherboards come with M.2 nvme slots now.
- The usb port cable needs a 90 degree option as my plug in is mounted facing up, not to the side.
- There should be a cutout in the power supply garage for the graphics card/s cables, other than the one for a radiator.
- The inside of the front bezel is piano black. Had to sand and paint mine a gold accent, flat black next time please.
- The feet come in silver, sanded and painted gold as well, flat black next time please.
- I find the fractal logo in the front of the case distracting, removed mine and it looks more odd, leave it out next time please. Or better yet, make it for the cpu and graphics card badge stickers, that would be sweet.
- Lastly, love the triangulated front mesh. Give us some more mesh options though, like a plain one, or a shaped plain one, if that makes sense. Stamp different shapes is all im saying. I am looking to paint the mesh in a future build is all.
Overall Review: Though I had some cons, they were minor ones, I give this case 5 eggs. This is the best case I have seen in a really long time. Fractal trimmed the fat so to speak and created an affordable, well built, well thought out solution for computer builders. The ATX form factor was the first motherboard size to be standardized and the Meshify C is an awesome nod to ATX motherboard enthusiasts like myself. Its hard to imagine how they would improve this design, see my cons (wink). I was all hung up on Inwin, then Phanteks, saw this case! The Gloves have definitely come off! Yes, I own and use this case, love it. I'm going to get another one and mod some more, such a cool case, so affordable. I was torn over this case or the Enthoo Evolve micro ATX case. The front design of the Enthoo Evolve, but with mesh is waiting to happen, hint hint.",0.0,4.0,11.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- The cable management really is as advertised. You should not have any issue putting together your system and getting the motherboard side panel to close without issue.
Cons: -The front audio jack is giving me a lot of problems. I have to jam the cable into the socket in order to get sound to come out of both sides of my headphones, and even then the sound coming out of the right side is filled with frizzing and other distracting noises. Making my favorite mode of listening quite irritating.
- My main point of concern with this product is the customer service. I am currently going into my third day of waiting in queue to even receive some sort of message from a representative from Fractal Design. I was hoping that I could get a relatively minor issue like this resolved in within 24 hours but it seems they are quite busy indeed.
Overall Review: I may end up returning this case at this rate, which is a real shame as I enjoyed using this chassis. The headphone jack is a real sticking point for me and I did not read anything negative about socket after doing some extensive reasearch before my purchase. I am thinking I just got unlucky with the case I received, and maybe for those of you out there looking for a high airflow, low cost case won't have this problem.",0.0,4.0,11.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Sorry for the delay in responding. There's been a rather nasty bout of the flu going around and our support team hasn't gone unaffected, so things have been a bit slower than usual this past week but we're thankfully now starting to catch up fairly quickly. I checked our ticketing system and was able to find what appears to be your case, and you should already have a reply from our support team. If you haven't yet seen it, please be sure to check your junk mail folder just in case it ended up there by mistake, or you can view responses directly at support.fractal-design.com using ticket #54458.

Fractal Design Meshify C Black ATX High-Airflow Compact Dark Tint Tempered Glass Window Mid Tower Computer Case,1267.0,5,89.99,Lary L.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,7/2/20 7:58,5.0,"Pros: -cable management is otherworldly. The only visible cables in my entire build at the PCIe for the graphics card, and about an inch of the USB for my Corsair h100i
-the top lint filter is magnetic
-super easy to build in because of the design, and how much of it you can see through with the top lint filter off
-airflow is perfect: with this and an h100i AIO my CPU doesn't get above 60C running the prime95 stress test (intel core i7-7700k is normally a very hot chip), and my vega 56 card running on air stays around 30 idle, maybe 50 or 60 in-game
-very pretty case
-somehow small but spacious at the same time. It's the size of a standard prebuilt, maybe a little taller, but it somehow is as spacious as a full ATX
-the holes for fans/radiator at the top are moved far enough forward that it won't collide with the RAM, and it's still easy to run cables through the top ports even if you install the radiator first
-has an actual hard drive rack, and it's under the PSU cover so you don't have to see it and it doesn't interfere with airflow
-has a PSU cover built in so you don't have to buy separately or 3D print one
-the glass is just the right amount of tinted: 2 RGB fans at the top are more than enough to show off the build
-the preinstalled fans are very quiet
-you can install not 1, but 2 SSDs on the back, and the plate for them is removable so it's still easy to install a CPU cooler that needs the back of the mobo
-it has a bottom lint filter that's easy to take out and clean
-has preinstalled Velcro straps on the back for cable management
-idk how, but the 2 USB ports on the front somehow only require 1 USB 3.0 header on the mobo, which is really nice
-this case fully deserves the numerous awards its gotten
Cons: -I wish the glass went on more like the Coolermaster Maker because the glass gets fingerprints when you undo the finger screws to put it back on
-the mesh part on the front is difficult to remove due to the plastic snaps instead of screws
-the metal on the top felt a little bendy when I was installing my radiator. It's definitely not going to bend under the weight of the radiator itself, but you'll have to hold up the radiator while screwing.
-not really a con, but it's a lot smaller than it looks. Still plenty of space to build in though.
Overall Review: -I wish I could upload pictures of my build, because I can't emphasize enough how wonderful cable management is in this thing
-other reviews have complained about it being hard to install a radiator/AIO, and idk what they're talking about it. It is SUPER easy, everything should reach fine, and there's so much space that you don't even really have to train the cables/tubes. I've even seen pictures on builds.gg of people installing 2 for liquid cooling on the CPU and GPU.",0.0,2.0,5.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Aesthetically pleasing
-company isn't based in China, they're a Swedish company

-broken fan on arrival
-Tempered Glass is not sturdy at all. Putting it on the case it dropped 1/4 of the inch on rubber grommet and shattered. just as much my fault as cheap glass
-made in China

Sorry to hear about the broken fan and your mishap with the TG panel. We definitely owe you a replacement on the fan if it arrived with damage. The tempered glass panels used in these cases are normally quite durable as well, and it really shouldn't have shattered so easily. If you could please get in touch with us at support.fractal-design.com, we'd greatly appreciate the opportunity to look into both these issues and replace any damaged components as covered under the standard warranty.

It's got good airflow. The construction is good and it has excellent cable management. No problem fitting a full size 2060 super in there. I'm a big fan of the filters as well.
Cons: If you are working in this case and you are installing an atx board it's super tight. There is just not much room to work with inside the case. It was particularly difficult to get to the cpu power, and plugging in the front case inputs sucked.
Not the end of the world just not the easiest case to work in. For me personally I wish it had more HDD mounting points. But I've got a lot of drives. Ultimately I had to leave out one of my SSD, although I could have velcroed it in there somewhere.

Easily accommodates a Corsair H115i Pro RGB AIO. Reasonable price.
Cons: Front panel (FP) cables are permanently affixed to the FP. Want to remove the FP completely and set it aside, disconnect all the cables from the motherboard. You can however, swing it out of the way. Another biggie is the length of the cable for the FP USB 3.0 connectors. IT’s TOO SHORT. For my motherboard, the cable has to be a banjo string to reach the MB port and run diagonally. Ordered an extension to placate my wire management OCD. Also the stock fans are 3 pin, not 4 (PWM). Finally, it’s a black case and it would be nice if all of the wires from the FP where black when they terminate at the connectors for the MB. Some are old school rainbow colors when they exit the jacket.
Overall Review: Would like to see Fractal overcome the Cons, include USB Gen1 / USB Gen2 connectors on the FP and put grommets on the basement cutouts. Also, is a fingerprint magnet but that’s expected. Overall, a very nice case and would recommend.",0.0,1.0,3.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Mesh on top of case secured with magnets, which works well for stationary unit, but if you are moving it around, this will get knocked off.

Cons: There are several issues I take with the case that make me go ""why?""

1) If you plan on liquid cooling you may have issues, because their are quite a few limitations to doing so! Clearance height of memory, rad thickness, gpu length, etc...ALL which could of been a non-issue if fractal simply increased case height by 1 inch to provide more room up top, and 2 inches in depth so gpu length was a none issue...would of also helped if they increased the space between the front panel so fans could actually be installed behind it, instead of in the case. Which would give even more space for gpu and rad.

2) Bottom PSU shroud, I don't have a crazy big psu...I use a corsair 850 watt, full modular. I needed to keep the hard drive cage because I have 2x 3.5"" drives, but even with it slid all the way forward the psu cables had to be jammed against the cage, and I do mean jammed! And im OCD with my cables, I spent 4 hrs going from my old case to this one, meticulously doing cable management! Now if they increased the depth of the case for the reason I mention on above on point 1, this would also address this issue!

3) Front panel not fully detachable! Self explanatory here!

ISSUES IN DEPTH:

1) Despite my tridentZ memory being over the clearance of 40mm, I attempted to fit fractal's S24 AIO up top, and it fit but was resting on my memory modules and I wasen' t comfortable with that! Ontop of that it covered quite a bit of my motherboard including my debug code display and my top heat-sink. I have an issue with this, with ALL the time/effort motherboard manufacturers put into making current high end boards look bad*** its a shame that a case manufacturer would design a case, advertise liquid cooling capable, but then all that beauty gets covered up! In my opinion a typical setup of 30mm rad + fans should end up at the top of the mother board, so you aren't covering anything up! I mean the whole point of a glass side panel is to make a build you can show off! But aye what do I know?! I ended up doing what I didn't want to do which is put the rad up front, luckily my MSI GeForce GTX 970 GAMING 4G wasn't too long! I have about 1/2"" between my rad and gpu. Down side to this method was because I need that hard drive cage I couldn't lower the rad far enough to get 2 fans up top, only 1. Which hurts my air flow!

CONCLUSION:

I like what they were going for, I just don't think everything was thought out as well as it could have been! I would kill for a full tower version, so room is no longer an issue! Or slightly increase the size of this mid-tower, 1 inch up to, 2 inches in depth, and slightly in the front to allow fans to be installed behind the front panel. The look of the case is just perfect in my opinion, I wouldn't change that...And I do like it, just disappointed I couldn't fit things in the way I would of liked too! Not fully satisfied, but I bought it so im stuck with it for now! lol

Great hard drive bay storage mounting system
Looks great.
Fair price.
Easy to wire, and has tons of tie downs and grommets to snake wiring back behind the board.
2 USB 3.1 connections at front of tower.
1 USB 3.1 connection in the back.
1 USB C connection in the back.
Cons: Smaller case, will not fit a EVGA CLC 280 dual radiator and a large graphics card like GTX 1060.
This unit does not have the cut away allowing you to push the hard drive bay back to fit a 3rd 120mm fan. Videos are showing a different version on youtube.
Even if you could slide the hard drive tray back, a normal size power supply like a EVGA SuperNOVA 850W power supply would not allow it as the wires coming out of the hard drive have very little room as it is.



No CD/DVD/Blu-ray bay bay.
Overall Review: I have to jimmy rig my second fan on my water cooler (do not plan on overclocking the i7 8700k) to fit my video card and cooler. No room to mount it above, and case is not long enough front to back to mount it on the front. For this reason I would not likely buy this case again.",1.0,0.0,19.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- The TG is outstanding. 3 mm thick - nice!!

- Price is very good for a TG case.

- I LOVE the size. I have so much more room on my desk.

- Cable routing is a dream - no issues while building.

- Easy to clean filters - filter on the bottom slides out. The front filter pops out, you have to reach your fingers under the front bottom and the filter comes out, no wires are attached. You can pull the entire panel off but that's not necessary to clean the filer. Very nice design!!
Cons: - My case was bent - my EVGA Z370 Classified motherboard did not align with the back plate and as a result I was not able to insert a display port, HDMI or other any other connectors. Not happy. I was under a time crunch to get this build completed and did not anticipate having to make case modifications to correct fitment issues with the motherboard. In the end, it all worked but it took a lot of time and trial fittings before I finally got it to align.

- Case fans make a droning noise. I am going to have to replace both of them. The droning or bearing noise is giving me a headache. Not sure what the deal is, maybe I just got a bad one. My Define R 5 had no fan issues.

- I have a big CPU cooler, a CoolerMaster Pro 280 mm. It barely fit in the front of the Meshify. I would not use this big of a cooler in this case. A 240 mm would be an easier fit up front. BUT I already had the big 280 mm and I was not going to spend money to buy a smaller cooler. So it is what it is. On the plus side my Core i7 8700K idles between 23 C and 25 C - that's about 77 degrees in the Meshify - wow!!
Overall Review: - Would not recommend for the novice builder. There were many changes that could be easily avoided buy buying a another case. For example the Define R 5 is a much easier build. More room to work in. My Define R 5 was not bent. Fans on my R 5 were very smooth and silent. My opinion the Define R5 is better quality.

- I would buy again because I really like the looks and the size. I would just be better prepared for the challenges ahead.",0.0,1.0,14.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

- Clean look
- Lots of space for a giant fan
Cons: - Not much room for power supply cables if you have full sized drives
- The back side for cable management gets cramped
- Glass apparently breaks easily
Overall Review: Not necessarily a case issue and rather a delivery/customer support issue. The window was shattered at some point in transit. In hopes of getting a replacement window, I went ahead and finished the build. Today when I contacted Newegg about it, they can't replace the window and instead want me to send in the whole case for a replacement. This would require disassembling the entire build and leaving my 13 year old gamer nephew without a computer. Pretty disappointed with this. Can't seem to find anywhere to get a replacement and Fractal Design's website says they sell it, but don't know when it will be in stock.

I ended up putting clear packing tape on both sides of the window to keep the glass from completely crumbling (the film is the only reason this was possible) so we're able to at least close it off and keep dust out/air flow in.

All in all, I'd recommend going with a case that does not have a glass window and if yours is shattered, postpone the build until you get a replacement.",0.0,0.0,4.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Nice design look with dark tempered glass and fractal front grill. Has good options for water cooling. Includes dust covers and 2 stock fans. Ability to fit 850 watt psu. Excellent! wiring channel with velcro ties. Good space behind motherboard for ssd's and fan controllers. Good wiring slots above motherboard for wiring.
Cons: Front fan location slots don't allow enough travel from top to bottom. This would be nice option for 120mm fans x2. For 3-120mm fan placement should be option to adjust bottom cover plate (Its either in or out) Could be modified with dremel DYI for fan width spacing.This isn't problem for 140mm fan placement or water fan setup.
Top cooler placement is fine with 120mm fan width cooler, but at 140mm probably not going to happen. Could increase top of case dimensions by at 2"" to better accommodate larger cooler and allow a bit of room to motherboard.
Glass side panel mounting screw very sketchy?? be very careful removing glass panel. Lower channel and better mounting could help. Glass corner protection would be good also.
Better magnets on top filter mesh.

Cable management is no problem, and it has dust filters for every opening on the case sans the rear exhaust that doesn't need it. Looks properly cool without being flashy.
Great for air cooling.
Cons: Could be a bit small for those wanting more than one AIO radiator or building an open loop cooling solution.
If you like to look at the internals of your build make sure you have some LED lighting as the glass panel is a bit dark, but I can confirm that LED lighting is still very easily seen through it.

I dropped two eggs from this case since using Fractals own S24 AIO CPU cooler will not work with a Z370 MoBo and TridentZ RAM. The fans or radiator will not fit due to being blocked by the heat spreaders on the RAM. For such popular RAM and common AIO size, this is a major oversight on Fractals part. Front mounting an AIO is no better as you will not be able to fit GTX graphics cards. This case is basically an inch to small in all directions.
Overall Review: I bought this case with the intention of running only air cooling. Then I discovered the air cooling solution I had wasn't going to work with my mother board and RAM so I started researching 240mm AIO's for a top mount config. Nothing will work in this case, at least not with TridentZ RAM and a GTX 1060-1080Ti GPU. If you want to liquid cool in this case be aware of your component dimensions first, it will be a tight fit trust me.",0.0,0.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: Had two bad deliveries. The first case came with a massive crack and dent on the side. The box it was transported in was mangled and I could already tell once I got home that the case was going to be damaged.

The 2nd case was phisycally fine, but once I set up my PC and tried to power on the system. Nothing happened, I tried a different power supply and still nothing. I the powered the PC using the motherboard and it worked. Found out the cable that led to the power button on the Fractal case was the issue. So this was the 2nd case in a row I had to RMA.
Overall Review: I do not reccomend the delivery system Newegg uses since the first case came physically damaged. As for Fractial I have used other products and never had an issue before so I would say to give them a chance.",0.0,0.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Cons: -Poor temperatures
Overall Review: The difference between this and the closed front Define C in terms of temperatures is marginal. Yes this case uses a front mesh but it's choked horribly by the foam dust filter embedded inside the mesh. I observe a 7C drop in GPU temperatures from removing the front panel all together. To make this case usable, you have to unclip the mesh holding the foam filter and discard the foam all together that way you actually get decent temperatures but lose 90% of dust filtration.

I would not use this case with a open air 200w+ TDP GPU. It will just recirculate it's own hot air.

Why Fractal opted to use a foam filter is baffling but in doing so did nothing to improve on the design of their Define C.",0.0,0.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

-Doors are easy to remove and install plenty of clearance for cable stuffing
-Tons of cable management accessories, tie down points screw holes
-SSD plate on the back is easily accessible swapping drives is a breeze space for 3 SSD's
-Filters everywhere front top bottom love it
-Accessories screws in well placed baggies with zip ties and microfiber towel for cleaning that glass panel :)
-two fans provided
-Looks like a small case but i fit in a ton of stuff do some research on the constraints but wow everything fits nice and snug
Cons: -The moment i opened and revealed the case it had the feel of a 29.99 DIYPC case made out of razor blades
-None of the screws holes seemed like they were sturdy enough to hold anything up
-The standoffs were not preinstalled and were so hard to install in the case i had to put some real pressure on the case to put those suckers in
-When i exerted my force putting in the standoffs the metal though they claim is sturdy began to pop and make noise as though it was at its breaking point.
-After that nightmare of almost breaking the case in half i almost broke off the front panel trying to take that off wow really sturdy case fractal I'm not the hulk i try to be extremely careful
-There seems to be a theme here everything looks wonderful but at the cost of some real cheap and dumb implementations of materials ( i guess this is why its on the cheaper spectrum of brand name mid tower cases)
-Front panel connectors were shorter than i wanted had to really tug on the usb 3.0 plug probably ripped of the small amount of hot glue holding it in and snapped a bit of plastic oh well another minus on the board

Cons: There is absolutely no room for SATA cables or PSU cables. Also, the screws do this weird thing where they don't come out all the way they just flop around attached to the case. I mean if you don't make any adjustments with the front fans (ex. adding a third 120mm or 2x 140mms) I guess I could see it being a justifiable option, yet it has insufficient space in the lower compartment. All your PSU cables will feel smushed, and you will end up spending hours making sure your SATA cables aren't about to snap the tabs off when you close it. I despise this case and have immediate buyers remorse. FYI I'm using an EVGA 550W G2 so sizing down is not realistic, it has many design flaws don't be fooled by the seemingly perfect reviews. I hate this garbage can with a passion.

- The front mesh looks amazing
- Build quality is solid
- As an air cooled case it is awesome.
Cons: - Not much room for a long power supply and the hard drive cage at the bottom.
- Having to remove the hard drive cage, or sliding it closer to the PSU (which wont work because of the cables), to actually install 3 120mm fans.
- RAM clearance for AIO liquid coolers when mounted on the top is horrible.
- Really needs grommets on the top of the PSU shroud to make running cables to the bottom left of the motherboard easier.
Overall Review: I was going to move a Ryzen 7 system from a Phanteks Enthoo Primo to this case. Lets just say that didnt go very well. My SeaSonic SnowSlient PSU was a little longer (with the cables installed), and didnt fit comfortably with the hard drive cage installed. The cables were pushing against the hard drive cage located at the bottom of the case. Since I have 2 6TB hard disks i needed the drive cage. If users of this case have SSD's then this wouldnt have been an issue, as i would have removed the drive cage. With no cable routing grommets on top of the PSU shroud running cables and USB headers that were located on the left side of the motherboard was annoying and a pain.

To install 3 120mm fans, you have the option of sliding the hard drive cage closer to the PSU or removing it and installing a hard drive mounted to the bottom of the case. The issue with this is that there is no room for routing the PSU cables very well. Removing the ""plate"" that allows for the installation of the 3rd 120m fan, is ugly and honestly doesnt look good.

I am biased, I went from a massive full tower case to this one thinking things would be great. Fractal Design is known for quality products and this case shows their quality in spades, i just should have been more careful building in this case. And that is the biggest issue, i should have to change hardware to fit into a case, cases should accommodate the hardware. Now if i was building a computer from scratch in this case, i would have planned more, but some of the issues are just too much for me",0.0,0.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Moving from a large full tower to a compact mid tower typically will present a few challenges and limitations to plan for, but it sounds like you were able to complete the transition and provide some excellent feedback in the process. The grommetted pass-through on the top of the PSU shroud is a great suggestion, and we'll most certainly continue exploring new ways to improve headroom and overall component support in that area as well.

Removable dust filters protecting all but the back.

Nice to look at, but that is a matter of opinion.
Cons: No internal 5.25"" bays. When motherboard manufacturers start supplying their drivers on USB flash drives I'll be somewhat more comfortable with this. Still, there are fan controllers that supply panels that fit 5.25"" bays. No excuse to not have at least one.

The front mesh/dust filter was a REAL pain trying to remove. You cannot mount front fans unless it is removed, and the supplied manual for this case is so vague that it might as well had never been printed in the first place. You have to first remove the bottom filter, then shove your fingers up a bottom hole while simultaneously using your offhand to push forward and slide down. Not a fun time. I've seen plenty of YouTube videos where people don't even know you can remove the mesh; they instead remove the entire front panel. I can understand why, this thing being such a mess.

The back panel doesn't leave much room for cables. Yet, the HDD/SSD bays are facing outwards. By the time I got the SATA cables and SATA PSU cables installed, they were uncomfortably snug, and the back panel had to be forced on. I absolutely hated this. If you don't intend to use mechanical HDDs, you'll probably be fine. I put 2x 2 TB HDDs in and I'm worried they'll get damaged by the pressure.

The motherboard offsets, some of them seemed to screw in forever. This made me nervous.
Overall Review: I'm going to tell you this much, if you plan to get this case. Ignore it at your own peril:
GET PSU CABLE EXTENSIONS!
Get them for the motherboard power, at the LEAST!
Get them for the CPU and PCIe power, too, and if you intend to use mechanical HDDs, you'd best get some soft and flexible SATA power cables. I used a SeaSonic PRIME Ultra Gold 750W. It was my first Seasonic, and perhaps my last. The cables are just too friggin' stiff! If I had gotten cable extensions I would've been golden, but NO! I didn't think I needed them. WRONG!

Looks great.
High quality build.
Cons: Cannot remove front mesh.
Overall Review: If the front mesh works, then I would recommend it. I've spent 20 minutes looking at instructions and videos trying to figure out how to remove the mesh without removing the front, and it is not happening. I workout on a regular basis, and the mesh is not moving. I keep accidentally popping off the entire front panel because I am forcing the mesh with such force that it doesn't move. They should really consider improving that mechanism.

If the front mesh pops up I would recommend, but right now I am very disappointed and regret the purchase. As dust builds in the front, there won't be a way to clean it.",0.0,0.0,1.0,67.0,248.0,1,1,1

Sorry to hear you're having trouble removing the front mesh filter from the front panel of your Meshify C. After removing the bottom mesh filter, you may need to tilt the case upward from the front to more easily reach in and pop the retaining tab loose.

Cons: The only con I've had with the whole experience is that my glass side panel came in with noticeable scuffs along the top end.

That's why i'm removing 2 eggs. Some may say 2 eggs is quite harsh for a minor cosmetic issue but the only reason i bought this style of case was for it's aesthetics.

I'm sorry to hear your new Meshify C has failed to meet your expectations. Optical drive bays are becoming less and less common in the latest PCs and PC cases, and though the Meshify doesn't advertise any optical drive support I can understand how you might assume it's there just because, up until recently, it's generally always been there before. If you do need an optical drive with your PC in the Meshify C there are still plenty of external options out there via USB, but if you intend to install a traditional internal 5.25"" drive this is something you'll need to look out when buying a new case since fewer and fewer new models support them.

Like many newer cases the Meshify C does not have an optical drive bay, however you can remove the front cover fairly easily for cleaning and maintenance if you need to. Just pull the bottom filter from the front to remove it, and then you can reach under the front bezel and press to release the mesh panel. I wish I could help you with the DVD drive, but for cases like the Meshify C you'll unfortunately need to go with an external solution such as USB.

-Durability specs on par with class-leading products, and a warranty to match
-Outstanding speed-to-cost ratio
Cons: -Heat sink is pure marketing, as far as I can tell
-Binding arbitration clause in the fine print, forcing the buyer to waste time and a stamp writing to WD in order to get normal American consumer protections
Overall Review: My initial impression of this product are very positive. Install was trouble-free. Blackmagic Disk Speed Test clocks it at 2723.6 write, 2895.3 read in my system. This is quite good, a full 25% faster than the Samsung 960 Pro product it replaced in my system on write speed (measured, not claimed). Read speed is basically a wash against the 960 Pro. Indeed, this product seems very competitive with the newer 970 Pro in terms of speed, endurance spec, and warranty. Of course, endurance spec is one thing and actual endurance is another, so time will tell, but off the bat this product seems to deliver very close to class-leading performance at a really excellent price-point.

My only qualms so far: First, as far as I can tell, the heat sink and non-heat-sink versions of this product are identical in absolutely every regard, aside from the block of aluminum. Temperatures on mine are well within tolerances, even after hammering 4K video writes to it, so the heat sink appears to be purely decorative in function in a system with adequate cooling. This is not to say it doesn't work, only that the underlying product is identical in form and function without it. The manufacturer could just say as much and save customers some time. Second, buried in the fine print of the manual is a binding arbitration clause. You can opt out but you have to write to WD to do so. That fact that you now need to take extra steps buried in the fine print in order to access consumer protections that we consider normal in the United States (i.e. the right to recoup your money in a class action suit if a product turns out be defective) does not give me a warm-and-fuzzy feeling about WD.

TL;DR: Seems great so far, if you are looking for high-performance but concerned with value as well this appears to hit the sweet spot. Just don't waste your money on the heat sink.

Free download of Acronis from WD website to clone or copy drive (not advertised).
Good value when found on sale
Cons: When i first booted it up it took a bit to load photos thumbnails, like 10-15 seconds where my old SSD showed them instantly. It doesn't seem to be doing it now, may be some other issue caused it.

No heat spreader included on my model

Not much in the way of instructions in the box, pretty plug and play though.
Overall Review: So far so good, I've had it installed for about a week and it seems to be performing fine. Windows 10 and application load times are comparable to my old sata SSD, and I honestly expected a little more of a noticeable performance difference being M.2. I'm running a Ryzen 5 3600 on a x570 MB with 16gb of 3200 ram, so it's a fairly up to date system with PCIE 4.0 capability. It looks good, runs well so far, is nice and tucked out of the way without a ton of cable mess to deal with. If you're buying this and expecting a super upgrade compared to a sata SSD, you might be a little disappointed. Bonus tip - if you go to WD's website and search for Acronis software you can download a free version if you need to use it to clone your drive. Worked for me at least.",0.0,6.0,6.0,20.0,99.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: Got a laptop with a 1TB 5400RPM HDD, was trying to be a cheapskate last year and opted for a 32GB optane module vs. putting in a SSD, maybe mine was defective? I had 2-3 instances where data became corrupted, which led to 100% data loss and having to factory restore my system - not cool... so I bought this drive, loaded windows 10 fresh with a thumb drive and now no more fears of my system imploding, it's even more speedy since EVERYTHING is on the SSD now not just whatever the intel setup deems needs acceleration.

Cons: None
Overall Review: Got back into pc gaming a month ago and started out simple with an HP omen. (Best Buy was running a great deal) Only issue I ran into right off the bat was the 256 GB SSD it came with. Filled that with 4 games. Did a bunch of research and picked this up knowing I will be building a full rig after next gen graphics drop.

Everything is great now that it's up and running. I did have issues with cloning the old SSD because as I found out HP was not as upgrade friendly when it comes to the SSD. I've been away from PC building for 5 years so I know my knowledge isn't all there with the new tech but I ended up having to use two different apps to clone the way I wanted. From what I gathered on the forums HP may not like people cloning their OEM drives out of their PC's.

In the end I paid for Acronis but it wouldn't clone the drive so I used Macrium (free) to clone the drive then swapped back to Acronis to deal with the partitions because for whatever reason neither would do both. Even with the learn on the fly approach I was able to get everything done in about a half hour with the clone process itself being 15 mins. I picked up the Asus Arion for the enclosure which I know was over kill but Im using the old SSD as a flash drive and like the enclosure.

Ran ATTO and went from 144MBs write 722MBs read old drive to 2.8 GB/s write 3.2 GB/s read on this.

Cons: -None that I've experienced yet.
Overall Review: I bought this NVME drive when it was on sale a couple weeks back for a brand new gaming focused build I was doing. The thing that got my attention at the time was WD's rated speeds for their 1TB and higher drives. They boast some of the fastest read/write speeds on the market for PCI-E NVME SSDs. And according to the benchmark tests(CrystalDiskMark) I've done, those speeds are 99.9% accurate at least with my personal WD BLACK SSD. This is the first WD branded SSD I've owned. I've used numerous examples of their mechanical 3.5"" drives over the years and I've never had issues with them. For a mechanical drive, their reliably and speed has always been strong selling points with me. So far, it looks like the same is going to hold true with their NVME SSD drives.

Very happy with my purchase. Using it as my OS drive and putting the games I play most on it. The system is incredibly snappy, windows boots in mere seconds, load times have been drastically reduced and the thermal performance on this drive seems good. No temperatures which I'd deem abnormally high.

Overall Review: - Bought this to replace Samsung EVO 970 2-TB which had started throwing BAD BLOCK errors into Windows Event Viewer (which I found when Acronis failed to make an image)
- Replaced the drive, booted from Acronis rescue media, browsed to the last good image and restored. Took about 20 minutes to restore about 250GB of image.
- Windows would not boot, tried to self-repair, couldn't. After an oh-oh moment, I booted into Safe Mode with Networking, disabled all startup programs and rebooted. No problems. Enabled all the startup progs one at a time and now all is well. Could have been an Acronis glitch or a result of changing SSD type/make (I just bought another one of these in case that was the cause)
- The PC is now running fine, and there is a modest but noticeable and measurable improvement in disk speed compared to the Samsung drive.

It was setup quick and easy and is running very well at good temps. (see my overall review). I can recommend these to family, friends and others.
(A note) I recall seeing in reviews the WD Black SN750 failed to register at Western Digital with a response that it was OEM. The packaged drive I received from Newegg registered quickly at Western Digital when inputting the SN and other info. Thought you might like to know.

Overall Review: Received this ordered drive from Newegg, well packaged and sealed in its product box in a very timely manner and no damage.

Installed the WD SN750 after moving motherboard M.2_1 socket mounting standoff from last hole to the 2280 position. M.2 hold down screws came with the MSI motherboard. I had already created a Windows 10 ver 1903 USB stick with the media creation tool. I wanted a new OS install on this drive. A boot into UEFI BIOS showed the drive as detected. I shut the PC down and inserted the created Windows 10 USB stick, turned PC on and hit F11 for boot menu, selected the USB Windows 10 install drive. The install booted and had the WD SN750 selected for install, I just clicked next since I was giving Windows the whole drive. Windows set the drive GPT and setup its needed partitions. The install went fast and smooth, (internet was connected at all times). ONE thing I noticed on this new install, there was no choice to use local administrator account, I had to set up a Microsoft Account because the screen would not progress forward until email address was entered. So I let it create a new account at outlook.com. It said Windows was not activated. I rebooted and clicked on the Windows update and let it process. Checked activation again and it was activated with a digital license. Installed motherboard chipset drivers and network adaptor drivers. Rebooted and ran chkdsk, ran sfc /scannow, it reported some corrupt files it could not repair. Ran DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth, after it completed ran SFC /Scannow, it found the corrupted files and repaired them. All is good. Crystal Diskmark reports WD SN750 reads 3450 writes 2550, drive temp 37 deg.

• Gorgeous Heatsink (The images don't do it justice).
• This is a perfect Fit! The heatsink is just about level with the height of the PCIe slot, so there is no interfering with your graphics card.

• The speed. Oh dear Gaaahd, the speeeeed!

Overall Review: The first thing I needed to know was, ""Is this thing as fast as it says it is?""
I installed windows from USB3.0 quickly, started installing drivers from my network and I don't think I've ever been dissatisfied to see that my bottleneck was a 1Gbps network transfer, lol. First file transfer was an 8GB MKV file from an old network drive. Came in at an average of 124MB/s, and this WD_Black drive was yawning. I duplicated the file to itself after the initial transfer and it showed a ""Windows Copying"" window for less than two seconds and *PoOf!* Two files there. I highlighted both and proceeded to copy 16GB in two files to the same directory. 2.56GB/s was reached as the ""Windows Copying"" window disappeared (along with any doubt in my mind) in under ten seconds. I'm in love! That;s just writing at read speed. I can't even imagine when I start video production with this drive.",0.0,4.0,5.0,20.0,99.0,1,1,1

Mind you I upgraded my old build from an AMD 8350 to a Ryzen 5 2600, a M5a99FX Pro to a Tomahawk B450, and a 10 year old 7200 rpm WD Black to this. So the difference is a bit stunning to me. The old WD Black is still running after all these years, which is why I went with WD again. I almost got the Samsung Evo 960 or 970, which would have both been great as well, but WD drives have done me well. I'm a bit dumbfounded as well, since this is the first time the PC is waiting for me to do something, instead of me waiting for it.

Overall Review: So I have been building computers for a few people. These computers have all had NVMe drives included in the build for the Operating System, as they should in this day and age. My current i7-4790K build (with a 4.6 GHz OC) has been running a Samsung 850 Pro 512GB drive. This drive has been performing well but getting a bit long in the tooth. In order to prevent data loss I decided to upgrade the OS drive. This was easier said than done as the original windows install on the PC was MBR and when the drive cloned to the NVMe there was some massive OS corruption. No fault of the drive, more fault of me. Well after massive data recovery everything is up and running. To give an idea of speed difference between an 850 PRO and an NVMe running on a PCI-e 2.0 x 4 (half speed of PCI-e 3.0 x 4) here are some fun facts: NVMe - MAX Read - 932 MB/sec; Burst Rate 374.8 MB/sec; Samsung Pro 850 Pro - MAX Read - 416.1 MB/Sec; Burst Rate 182.9 MB/sec. Great upgrade for an OS drive.",0.0,2.0,3.0,20.0,99.0,1,1,1

Increased speed of games that require a lot of data transfer such as EFT, TWW2, COH2, CIV6. Great price compared to other 1TB M.2's.
Cons: It is not the M.2 fault its just knowledge of what a M.2 does; a M.2 cancels out two of your SATA PORTS. So in my case my SSD with windows was installed was plugged into one of the SATA PORTS that the M.2 I installed canceled out so my pc would not start properly. Simple fix plug your cable into another SATA PORT that is not canceled out ( takes trial and error). Also after this problem my computer did not recognize the M.2. Solution: Go to the brands website and install the latest update for the M.2 and then you need to go to your drive in control panel and you will find a unrecognized drive you just need to initialize it.

Overall Review: I tried another drive and it doubled my boot time. This drive gave me the speeds I was hoping for and I'm very pleased with the results.

This SN750 is mounted on a RIITOP M.2 Dual NVMe PCIe 3.0 4x adapter. Was plug and play in ASUS Gryphon Z97 with NVMe controller 10.0.18362 and i5-4690K running Win 10 Pro (64-bit) on a dedicated Samsung 860 EVO 250 GB SATA III SSD. An Intel Pro/1000 GigE NIC is installed adjacent to the RIITOP adapter.

The WD Black SSD Dashboard (v2.7) provides a nice snapshot about the install and provides handy links to Windows System Properties and Disk Management info. The dashboard confirmed the PCIe 3.0 4x Interface Connection, drive info, and a Temperature of 36-39 C with typical disk reads/writes using a range of files (docs, hi-res images and HD video).

TRIM is enabled in Win 10 to extend SSD life. The drives in this system are configured to automatically optimize on a weekly basis.

CrystalDiskMark utility was used to compare read/write performance to vendor specs. This install exceeds vendor sequential write speed but falls slightly short of sequential read spec. Which is fine as this SSD is 6x the existing Samsung 860 EVO SATA III AHCI performance. I plan to run CrystalDiskMark utility regularly to compare results.

I'm not talking about benchmarks, but in the responsiveness of the system. Notable improvement over a SATA SSD in the same system.
Cons: Loud. Yes, you read that right. No moving parts, no fans, so it shouldn't make any noise, right? I bought two of these on sale, and both have noticeable noise when there is any load writing or reading. I tested one in my Dell laptop, and it was a noticeable hissing sound. The other one went into my main computer that I just upgraded this weekend, and it is distractingly loud with a very annoying high-pitch whine any time there is reading and writing. I will work with this for a little bit, but if it continues, I don't know if I can continue using the product.
Overall Review: I bought one of these for a build late last year, and didn't have any issues or complaints regarding noise, and it was very fast.

We regret to hear about your user experience with the WD BLACK SN750 NVMe Internal Gaming SSD and thank you for bringing this concern to our attention.

Please know that the internal SSD comes with the heatsink to prevent the drive from heating during peak drive operation, we would not recommend any attempt to remove the Heatsink of the SSD as it might damage the drive. If you are looking for a SSD without heatsink to be compatible with your computer or laptop's small space then you should consider our WD Black SN 750 NVMe SSD which also comes without heatsink.

We suggest you contact our Support team for any questions or queries you may have in the future related to Western Digital products.

We would recommend you to contact us by phone or email with reference to the Newegg review. We'd be happy to help.

We're sorry to hear about your initial experience with WD Black SN750 NVMe Internal Solid State Drive.

Please know that the screws to attach the drive with the motherboard usually come with the motherboard's case or in a plastic pouch with the computer. Each Motherboard manufacturer uses their own specifications for the Standoff screw's pitch and TPI. You can use the 3M screw to connect the M.2 SSD with the motherboard.

We would like to have the opportunity to address your concerns directly in order to setup the drive.

- No work install. Just plug and play.
- The speed in read and write times over SATA SSD is a no contest!

Heard about M2 several years back now but was reluctant to try something new. It never goes well when I do. The standard has come into itself now and the price is now unbeatable. Want to almost eliminate load times? Get one of these and see the difference. Don't forget to get some fast RAM, too if you want to keep those speeds up. You're only as fast as your slowest part.
Cons: - None so far.

Only problem that I had was my motherboard manufacturer sending me the wrong screw to lock these things down with. That was the motherboard manufacturer's fault and not with Western Digital.
Overall Review: These types of SSD's are for speed improvement for hard drives. I remember when solid state was the best in the beginning of the computer age, but micronization was still in its infancy. Now, it's in its prime! It's time to ditch old HDD SATA drives for M2 when it comes to your main storage device. You can still keep your old drives for those music collections and pictures, though.

This is actually my first SSD, so I’m a bit late to the party, but I am using it to augment my gaming machine. It took me some time to figure out that I needed to update the BIOS on my motherboard in order to be able to boot from this drive but once I did, ohhh boy! Windows now boots in less than 10 seconds versus the old 2+ minutes. My primary reason for picking up the WD Black SSD though was because The Division 2 used to take over 10 minutes to load (to the point of actually playing). Now I can go from PC powered off to playing in just under two minutes. I times this once from my old spindle drive and it took over 15 minutes to power up and immediately jump into the same game before I was able to move my character.

WD SSD Dashboard software UI to monitor the status and performance of my NVME M.2 SSD is a welcome addition so definitely download and install it. As for a quick benchmark, a transfer of a 2GB file from a WD Blue SSD using SATA 3.0 (6Gb/s) to the M.2 SSD transferred at a disk write of 204MB/s at just around 4 seconds. Fast indeed!

- FAST
- Reliable
Cons: Not quite as easy to clone drive as Samsung. You can use Acronis WD edition, but this is not as straightforward as Samsung's very easy software. I had to rebuild my BCD after doing a bare-metal backup and restore with the Acronis software. Samsungs drive clone just works.
Overall Review: We have a bunch of these in use at work. Been buying them for two years now (although not the same generation of WD Black both years. I have not had a single failure in 100 or so installations. They are incredibly snappy and reliable. For a fresh install, they are a no-brainer, but cloning from drive to drive is a slightly better experience with samsung, provided you also have some means to dock one of the drives. Cloning from m.2 to m.2 can be a dubious proposition if you don't have a means to mount both drives to the system simultaneously.

Warranty
Claimed durability
WD product
Cons: Write speeds was a bit disappointing (but definitely acceptable). Scores as low as 1600 were attained.
Overall Review: Installed this drive in a spare PCI-e slot with an aftermarket adapter. First try did not seat properly. But second attempt worked well. Drive was recognized in Windows 10 Home Disk management. The NVME was then formatted and given a drive letter assignment. Window file explorer did not shown the drive letter. Ultimately via Web searches it was determined to be a Windows issue requiring a relatively simple fix which corrected the issue. Crystal Diskmark64 scores showed excellent read speeds as high as 2500, while write speeds ranged from 1650-1940. Similarly AA-SSD Benchmark scored read speeds in excess of 3000 with write speeds of 2400. Temperature max was 110 degrees F. All in all there may be faster drives but I am happy with the purchase.

Update: 3/30/20: I am changing my 4 star rating to 5 stars. Here is why. When measuring speeds, one must factor in other peripheral constraints. All my other gear operates with far less speed than this device. In the case of my SATA SSD it is constrained to SATA speeds. My HDDs as well. Yes, the 1600+ to 1900+ speeds using Crystal Diskmark7 were reported but when I did an intra-disk copy of a 3.5 GB MKV it completed in 1.7 seconds ! I was astonished it could achieve that throughput. All in all your system will certainly benefit from this addition. It is extremely stable and quick.",0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,99.0,1,1,1

Cons: Warning: This isn't mentioned on the Newegg website, nor the WD website from what I can see. This drive comes with a ""contract"" (additional terms of service) including an arbitration clause. I don't see how this is enforceable since I bought a drive which is ""sold and shipped by Newegg"" and the contract is allegedly with WD. There is a small bit of tiny text written in mixed languages (seriously every couple sentences it changes languages) on the outside of the box which mentions the terms & services, and then a small booklet inside the box which explains the terms. The only winning move here seems to not play, if you don't agree with the arbitration clause. Not a big deal if you're only buying one drive, but if you're buying multiple for a larger install then this could become a problem quickly.
Overall Review: Still get the drive.. it brought new life to my laptop which was using a hybrid drive before. I migrated using Macrium Reflect (free edition) - it took only 45 minutes for a half-filled 1TB drive to clone. The only side effect is the new partition was only 1TB which left approx. 1TB of unused space on the SSD.

Overall Review: This drive has enabled me to load into games so quickly that in less than one day, all of my friends went out and ordered their own M.2 drives. I don't even see the Windows starting screen anymore - it's just post -> login. The device itself also hovers around 31-33 degrees during normal workloads.

The price of this SSD is pretty difficult to deal with. For just a few extra dollars, you can have a 4th gen M4 drive. For a fair bit cheaper, you can get an SSD that can still exceed 2000MBps read/write speeds. If you want a high performance SSD on an absolutely tight budget, then this is probably a great cutoff point, since I'm not sure what I'd even do with the extra performance.",0.0,1.0,2.0,20.0,99.0,1,1,1

- Simple install - M.2 format is so easy to use
- Clone Software - Worked seamlessly. Cloned my TB to a 500GB without any partition fiddling or adjustments. Auto detected the space and allocated appropriately. I work in IT, cloned a ton of drives, on par or better than the Samsung cloning tools.
- Fast - I can't say it enough. Windows throws selections at me like it knows what I am thinking.
- Price - I had a coupon! At purchase M.2 was really pricey. Just over $100.

New (2-3 wks at install) Lenovo Legion Y530 laptop i7 8GB 1050ti
Cons: - Price - This is so common in the world of hardware, but two or three weeks later I can get a 2TB drive for less than the 500GB. Not of the same speed as the Black but still faster than the rest of my computer.(Intel M.2 drives are so cheap right now!)
- Packaging - Didn't come with a board screw. ""Come on man!""
- Clone Software - Was a terrible experience to find the software on the WD site(NOT WD software). After finding it, the download was not the free version that comes with the hardware. The freeware version does not include the option to fully clone a drive. Got the right DL and all was fine.
- HEAT - This added a very noticeable amount of heat to my keyboard as the M.2 slot is fairly central on my laptop. During gaming and high usage of the card I get concerned for thermal performance throttling. I have not noticed this yet, but with the expansion of my PC gaming library it will probably become an issue soon.
Overall Review: - When running at such high speeds an M.2 drive will get so HOT. Consider cooling properties of your machine when selecting the speed and capacity of your drive.
- Laptops may have a hard time cooling this card, Desktop cases should have no issues.
- Addition of the drive took approx. 2-3 hours from cracking the case(laptop) to done with the drive clone. Very quick and easy for novice/beginner users. (Would have been faster if I could find the clone SW. User error.)",0.0,1.0,2.0,20.0,99.0,1,1,1

-I saw some people mention it has a B.S. warranty policy before I bought it but it was on a huge sale when I ordered it March 26, 2020. So I got it. It's May 12, 2020 as I'm writing this and it hasn't failed me. *knock on wood.* I mention this cause I've seen numerous reports saying it fails in a month and it's been over that for me.
Cons: -The software for it is fairly primitive but does the job.
-I took a star off cause I didn't receive anything to secure it. Only other SSD I have gotten in this M.2 format was a Samsung and it came with the little screw to secure it to the Mobo. This was packaged kinda crudely (not newegg, but the manufacturer) and it was just the SSD and the heatsink.

alas, there is a funky metal bracket which slips over the back and sides of the stick, screwing into the heat sink. and then it says not to touch it or it will explode and annihilate 7 city blocks, or something along those lines. so I unscrewed it and, finding that it did not simply slip off, hit it with the heat gun on low for a few seconds. the underside has a few stringy adhesive spots between the back of the stick and what looks like some sort of thermal transferring sticker doodad, which I can't imagine is doing much. anyway, heatsink intact and still somehow stuck on the chips, it fit right in the available m.2 slot no problem.

the True Acronis WD edition cloning software was very easy to download and install, was able to clone my harddrive over from my SATA SSD not problem.
The WD managing software was easy to download and install, allows you to manage the SSD, and turn on the ""gaming mode"" easily.
Cons: - does not come with a standoff or screw. fortunately my motherboard came with 1 spare standoff/screw, as well as its own heatsink.
Took me a few minutes to figure out how to install it. the SSD was only 80mm long so I had to install a new standoff in the appropriate 80mm recess at the M2 socket. then the heatsink is installed on top of the SSD with the already installed standoff and screw at 120mm. I also had to uninstall my graphics card in order to get at the m2 slot. I probably could have made it work without removing the GPU, but this just made the process easier.
(i'm using a x570 aorus elite).

Please know that the screws to attach the drive with the motherboard usually comes with the motherboard's case or in a plastic pouch with the computer. Each Motherboard manufacturer uses their own specifications for the Standoff screw's pitch and TPI. You can use the 3M screw to connect the M.2 SSD with the motherboard.

I read that these drives like large files, which is where most of the performance comes from. However, after a couple months of use, I never seen read speeds in excess of 3.5 GBps as advertised. In my usage scenario, it's not that much faster than using an SSD. The biggest files on my hard drive are roughly 1 GB each in size. Most of them are game install files packed in an archive. I thought that was a big file. However, this NVME drive doesn't read them any faster than a usual SSD. I guess you'd need really really big files, like 40 GB video or something to make use of this.

That's it nothing else good to say. So I'll follow mothers advice and say nothing (more)
Cons: This absolutely must be THE slowest NVMe SSD on the market!! No, not in read/write, it does fine there,. but in boot time? Kill me! Gag me with a spoon! This, in my fifteen years of building computers, is the absolute worst I have ever had to endure. This is supposed to be PCIe not SATA speed. WD you should be exceptionally ashamed of yourselves with this model! Stick to RE4's. Unless you wise up you'll never make it in an SSD world
Will I keep it? Yes. Long enough to buy a good drive like a Samsung 970 Pro. Then get rid of this Voilkswagon bus of an M.2 SSD.
I sincerely dislike having to create this kind of review but WD you deserve it.

We regret to hear about your user experience with the WD BLACK SN750 NVMe Internal Gaming SSD and thank you for bringing this concern to our attention.

Please know that the internal SSD comes with the heatsink to prevent the drive from heating during peak drive operation, we would not recommend any attempt to remove the Heatsink of the SSD as it might damage the drive. If you are looking for a SSD without heatsink to be compatible with your computer or laptop's small space then you should consider our WD Black SN 750 NVMe SSD which also comes without heatsink.

Please know that the screws to attach the drive with the motherboard usually come with the motherboard's case or in a plastic pouch with the computer. Each Motherboard manufacturer uses their own specifications for the Standoff screw's pitch and TPI. You can use the 3M screw to connect the M.2 SSD with the motherboard.

Cheap
Integrated Heatsink
Cons: None at this price point.
Overall Review: I have purchased three of the 1tb drives so far. First, I replaced my wife's aging 256gb NVME 950Pro, The WD drive is about 10-15% faster than the 950pro it replaced. So, recently since I was so impressed by the performance. I purchased 2 to build a raid-0 array on my EVGA z390 Dark, replacing a Plextor M8Pe 1tb drive. The Plextor was and is a great drive, however, it cant hold a candle to the performance of the SN-750 (15% faster on average).

Make no mistake, NVMe M.2 SSD drives are drastically faster than their SATA 2.5"" SSD counterparts.

If you are building a modern PC, get an M.2 Drive there are NO advantages to sticking with the SATA/SAS standards for a primary drive.

Also, with the added EK heatsinks the drives will keep peak performance much longer than a bear NVME drive, although you can purchase the drive without the heatsink. Also, I was pleased to find that the WD tool works even when the drives are in a raid array. If you have M.2 ports and want a great drive for very little money this is a great option. Oh and a 5 year warranty. I saw a review where someone was saying their drive isn't retail. Well, all of mine have been and were promptly registered with no problems..",0.0,0.0,1.0,20.0,99.0,1,1,1

Fast OS install.
Cons: So far so good.
Overall Review: Computer was sluggish on sata ssd, so I decided to get one of these and reinstall windows 10 (hadn’t had a fresh build since 2011 - I don’t count the free upgrade to windows 10).

Had to move graphics card to install this. Not a big deal.

Very fast installation of OS. Menus respond fast. Haven’t done any gaming or any other intense use of this because I’ve only had it installed two days so far.

Load XMP(DOCP) AND increase DRAM voltage by 0.01V or more (from 1.35 to 1.36 .... use +0.01v steps .... i guess its safe to try up to 1.4v)

I didn’t have to change anything myself as my motherboard recognized the RAM and all I had to do was go into my bios and turn on the XMP profile.

I’m using the AORUS B450 PRO WIFI motherboard with a Ryzen 5 3600X and the XMP profile was easily enabled and hasn’t given me any problems (yet).
Cons: The product is fine but it feels a little cheaply made. I ran into some minor problems when installing it as it felt like it was always clicking into one side of the DIM slot and loose on the other. Regardless, I can’t complain much for the price. I didn’t want RGB RAM so this product fit the description and gets the job done.

Overclocked to 3533 mhz at 16-17-18-34 timings and 1.38V, which yielded an 8% drop in latency and 3.4% gain in compute score over the XMP timings for an R7 3700x.
Cons: Not Samsung B-die?
Didn't seem to want to go below 16-17-18-34 timings between 3200 and 3533 MHz for some reason.
Overall Review: This ram turns out to be SK Hynix M-die. Compared to the gold standard Samsung B-die, it's not as much a star overclocker, but it does fare exceptionally well. This shows in the limited drop in CL timings. Most performance uplifts I got were in upping the speed and dropping the tRFC to 480. I did reach a stable 3600 MHz, but I sacrificed too much timing for it, the sweet spot for my set is between 3466 and 3533 MHz.

Overall Review: RAM is probably the easiest thing to upgrade in any system - but I'm going to advise you to buy the RAM you need up front - here is why:

There are 3 main manufacturers of RAM (the actual chips soldered to the RAM module). There are manufacturing differences between the 3, which means performance variation. The way RAM controllers work, you will only achieve the best performance of your worst module. The way RAM errors manifest - you will experience anything from intermittent computer crashes to complete inability to post.

Matched kits ensure that the actual RAM chips soldered to the module are from a single manufacturer - and everything is tested for compatibility. You're virtually guaranteed to get memory that works as rated, from any manufacturer. But if you buy an 8 GB module today with the intent of adding another 8 GB in 6 months, you don't get that same assurance - even if you order the same SKU again - manufacturing revisions are rarely advertised and are not readily apparent to customers in most cases (not just with memory).

Here is how to buy RAM:
1) Make sure it will fit in your system - low profile RAM exists for a reason
2) Buy the capacity, frequency, & CAS you need and want up-front
3) Deals happen around memory frequency, more than capacity - example: you will find 3200+ speed priced in the 2400-ish speed range, at times
4) Don't overbuy on Frequency or CAS - extra capacity can be justified as adding to the projected life of a system - Frequency & CAS might add a couple FPS today, but long-term won't mean much
5) Remember aesthetic frills, like RGB lighting, don't improve your gaming or content creation experience

They have great products and customer service and value is there as well...
-Fast DDR4 at a good price
-Decent tight timings
-I purchased 2 of these DIMMS last year around early Q4 15' to use with an Asus Z170 Deluxe MB. If I had reviewed these then it would have been 5 eggs.
-I followed these steps in 2015 with new build with no issues. Set overclock at Auto RAM settings, no issue. Set XMP profile on RAM, with overclock, no issues, only had to manually set DRAM to 1.35V as per G.Skill settings. Stress test, memcheck, all is good. Voila.
Cons: -Prices had gone down so I picked up another 2x8GB set of these to up my RAM to 32GB since Windows knows no end to its consumption...
-Immediately had issues posting. So I swapped sticks around since they are all the same SKU. Was eventually able to get it to POST and back into Windows. Stress testing failed. BSODS occurred. So I began troubleshooting...
-I flashed my BIOS to latest, which didn't help. I tried upping System Agent and VCCIO voltage to give RAM some more juice, no fix there either..
-I tried setting RAM to auto and that worked...
-Now I tried a variation of RAM speeds and set timing and voltage as G.Skill states. The lowest speed that everything worked at was 3000mhz with everything set manual in RAM settings.
Overall Review: It may just be my lack of knowledge of full memory banks and Z170 chipset, but this case seems like it was more hassle than needed to be
I like G.Skill products. But I posted this review in hopes to help someone else having an issue, as well as to let G.Skill know.
Not all MB + CPU + RAM combinations are going to work as stated by manufacturer and I understand that. I will buy G.Skill again.
I knocked one egg off for time to troubleshoot issue and 1 more for RAM not running at rated speed with full memory banks But at the end of the day it's working. And I can't expect any manufacture to fully support a configuration of overclocking with XMP, but it should be expected with modern hardware...

This is the second set I bought of matching pair to increase to 32GB on my Ryzen liquid cooled system and no appreciable heat increase.
Cons: So, yes you do need to go into bios and tweak some stuff so you do need to know how to go in there and not brick your board or anything else for that matter or do other damage but I believe their Tech support is pretty G.Skilled (sorry couldn't resist) and prob walk you through it if you have any knowledge of going into bios at all.

Cons: Running these in dual channel has been a nightmare. They work okay for a while but then Windows will have BSODs at random. Sometimes while gaming, sometimes at startup, sometimes while browsing. Windows Memory Diagnostics in two different motherboards say that they are okay individually but in dual channel install, something weird is happening because in extended test, sometimes they work, sometimes they do not.

-Not too tall

-Will blend in with most build themes

-After a small bios adjust my ram runs at said speed of 3200mhz
Cons: -I don't know if this a ram or motherboard issue but in order to boot up for my 1st build i had to remove one stick of ram after then it booted to the bios and after installing windows i put my ram stick back and it works for both now without a hiccup.

-If you're using a stock ryzen fan the little amd logo bump might obstruct a ram slot. It obstructed mine but you can just turn the fan towards the other side and problem solved!
Overall Review: All in all a really solid choice for ram. Not too pretty to charge a premium and not too ugly to stand out as the pariah of your build. Doesn't skimp out on the essentials and foregoes anything fancy 97% of consumers would gladly give up for a cheaper price point.

Overall Review: Im new to the whole building scene in the pc department. I was recommended to use a 2 stick kit with 16 gigs @ 3200mhz. And you know, it runs good with my asrock taichi motherboard. Should I feel the need to do so, I can ramp up the latency thanks to the infinity fabric inclusion. But Im new to this so probably wont. All I know is that this kit is definitely like the standard for a lot, and out of all the lotteries I have participated in, thankfully I win the silicone one",0.0,0.0,0.0,52.0,231.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I originally purchased 16gb of this ram and was very satisfied with it so I purchased another for a total of 32gb. Even with two different lots, they are running harmoniously together. Both times I received fresh sets that were manufactured the same month I got them which was nice. I have no complaints so far and I am very happy with my purchases. I would definitely recommend these and I would not hesitate to buy them again. I had no issues loading the settings for the frequency in my bios, ASROCK Fatality Gaming K6, utilizing the XMP profile and have confirmed the performance is operating to the specifications. I read some people had issues with this, but I think it really comes down to the motherboard and what kind of support and programming it offers. My bios is very user friendly and easy to use. In my case I found the memory not to be at fault and experienced no issues. It was easy to plug in and setup and booted on the first try. There is only one drawback I had with these but not enough to deduct an egg because I should have checked first. I have four slots for ram on my ATX board, and I was unable to fit all four with a CoolerMaster hyper evo 212 installed. I believe the sticks are taller with the larger heat spreader, but it could be a combination of the larger cooler. I have enough air intake from 3 front chassis fans so I was able to flip the setup to a pull configuration to free up space and still reduce temperatures while fitting the additional memory.",0.0,0.0,0.0,52.0,231.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: My first G.SKILL product. I've seen many people using them and found the price and speed reasonable. I also like to add that on their website my asus z170-A is not part of the QVL list. However I was still able to make it run at 3200 MHz in two steps (as oppose to one using XMP alone).

DDR4 which I needed for my Skylake build.

Plenty capable for what I need it for (gaming/streaming)

Good deal at the time
Cons: Doesn't run at rated speeds on my Gigabyte GA-Z170X-Gaming 5. I've tried it all and currently have it set to its highest possible stable speed of just under 2900. I did everything suggested by others including setting CPU VCCIO and System Agent voltage with no luck.

Fact of the matter is its advertised to work with Z170 and it doesn't quite at rated speeds. I'm waiting for a BIOS update to perhaps fix the XMP profiles to allow full use of RAM but until then I will be a little disappointed.
Overall Review: I've decided to keep the ram because I'm satisfied with the performance as is and I think this problem is well known now and will probably be addressed with a BIOS update at some point in time.

Installed to the mobo without any issues.
Cons: For the record, this is the only time I have docked an egg.

First, i'm not a techhead by any means, but i'm also not a complete moron. I did do my homework - and it just did not pan out. I purchased a MSI Z170A Titanium mobo - and everything I read said that XMP would work with this kit (says it on the dang box). Suffice to say, it did not work out for me.

Once installed, XMP enabled would crash the system, and had to default. I figured it was a voltage issue or timing - I have no clue. So I mucked about and was able to get it up to 3100 stable. Just could not get it to the advertised 3200. Still not sure what the issue is and at this point, the 'much about' tank is full.
Overall Review: What else blows, is after I bought all this stuff, I got blown out of country and that killed the 30 day return LOL!! Anyway, i'm just going to buy a new kit, and then sell this stuff on feebay.

Overall, i'm sure it's a good kit for a system that's compatible, just not working out for me. I'm not mad whatsoever, but I guess to a certain extent, you do roll the dice on components.

Cons: Sadly, RAM IS PRICEY =(.
So the ram failing a few weeks after originally writing this. To find out G Skill does not provide an advance exchange. So I had to order ram from Corsair who does provide advance exchange. Keep that in mind if you buy Gskill they have no advance exchange so if your issue intermittent. Instead of dealing with it waiting for the product. You will need have along down time or order other ram before you can RA ram. Not acceptable to me so I will not be purchasing their products anymore.",1.0,0.0,3.0,52.0,231.0,1,1,0

Regardless, I bought a second two stick kit identical to this and have had no compatibility issues at all and everything overclocked and is working perfectly together.

Cons: Can&amp;#39;t hold the nominal advertised 3200 Mhz frequency without showing errors in memory tests of a specific system.
Overall Review: My set up:
MB: Asrock B450M Pro4
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600 (65W TDP)
SSD: ADATA XPG SX8100 M.2 PCIe NVME SSD (.33W active)
Video Card: MSI GT710 ( Less than 20W )
PSU: Fatality Gaming 550W (An overkill for this system)

and of course this pair of G.Skill Ripjaws V 8GBx2 SDRAM add to a total of 16GB RAM for my Linux workstation setup.

During the initial set up phase, I didn't try any overclocking as usual, only turn on the XMP2.0 profile in MB which set the memory frequency to 3200 Mhz. Loaded the Linux Kernel 4.15.0.54, everything worked just fine. As soon as upgraded to Kernel 4.15.0.70, the system started to behave with a number of hiccups. The most annoying one is when I power down the computer, the fans are still running until I manually turn off the computer.

After a couple of days of troubleshooting ruled out all of the potential software causes, I then started to look into each of the hardware components. What a surprise! The memory test shows errors in a number of tests. What? no overclocking, auto adjusted voltages pumps 1.35V to the SDRAMs, running at the advertised 3200 frequency rate, gives errors?

As soon as I reduce the clock to 3133Mhz, all of memory test errors are gone! In my twenty years of building and testing hundreds of computers. This is the first time I have had such experience. Typically, RAM are advertised conservatively with a lot of head rooms because there are many potential reasons could impair their actual performance. If one is lucky, such as the system I build a couple of weeks ago. I was able to overclock a 2666Mhz rated RAM to 3200Mhz without increasing the voltage. I would not complain if I was able to run at the nominal 3200Mhz and see no memory test errors. However, if there is 1 Mhz lower than what&amp;amp;amp;#39;s advertised, then I would still not complain. But 67Mhz, which is 2% lower than advertised speed. Then I&amp;amp;amp;#39;d definitely voice my opinions. While other SDRAMs give a lot of head rooms, this SDRAM can&amp;amp;amp;#39; t hold the advertised frquency. That means, the quality of this pair SDRAM is lower than many SDRAMs I have used before. I could be the lucky one of receiving this bad pair.

Well, originally, I planned to return this item. I managed to placed this pair of SDRAM in another system which reached the advertised 3200Mhz without showing errors. I used a different set of SDRAM of another brand in this system to reach a better clock rate at 3333Mhz. Thus, I decided to cancel the return request in order to meet the project deadlines.

Anyway, my experience stands and just like to share my experience here. To be fair, I give it three eggs as a neutal score, instead of 1 egg I gave to it at first.",1.0,0.0,1.0,52.0,231.0,1,1,1

Seagate External Hard Drive 4TB HDD Expansion - PC Windows PS4 & Xbox - USB 2.0 & 3.0 Black (STEB4000200),260.0,4,84.99,Brandon W.,Ownership: 1 month to 1 year,Verified Owner,6/10/15 13:10,5.0,"Pros: This is my second Seagate external drive, with my first being a portable (no external power supply) 1TB drive. I’ve decided to put this one to use in two different ways. First, I’m migrating my little virtual machine “server” from Windows 7 to XenServer, and I have quite a few VMs to move. Second, after this, I’d like to move all of my pictures and music from my internal drive to this one. This tests both the large file transfer and multiple small file transfer (>100,000 files I think).

The bulk file transfer went over very smoothly. My VMs and related files took up almost 2TB, with some VMs being as large as 20GB files. I can’t remember the exact transfer speed, but I feel like it was somewhere close to 200MB/s. It took between an hour and an hour and a half to get them all transferred. Overall, I was very satisfied, I feel like the transfer part took longer than the actual export process (into OVFs).

Small/medium size files also went very well. Transfer rate isn’t as feasible of a measurement, but I transferred slightly under 1TB in total of various media files, including music, pictures, and videos. I had done this before with the Seagate portable drive, and this drive performed much quicker overall.

The enclosure is also very well designed. I feel like there is not much extra space used up to cover the drive, maybe only slightly thicker. It also looks nice, though I bet it also serves for a practical purpose as well. There are indentations all over the enclosure, and I think they help cool the device (but I could also be completely wrong about this… at the very least, I think they look cool). It’s also very quiet, the drive vibrations don’t rattle the shelf or anything on top of it.
Cons: The LED is a little bright for my tastes, and you can’t turn it off. Also, the drive is occasionally slow to get out of standby mode when you don’t use it for a while. However, for the most part, I have very little to complain about this drive.
Overall Review: A great backup drive, highly recommended. I’ve been attempting to become more reliable with backups, so this will help a lot. Also, since this is not one of the terrible Seagate 3TB drives, I’m not worried about reliability. That doesn’t mean to not have a third option for your backups!",1.0,10.0,10.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Cons: None
Overall Review: I was able to use this drive as both a stand-alone backup and connected to my NAS to use as a backup target. Connecting the drive to the machine and using Seagate’s software was probably one of the easiest things I have done. You basically click PC Backup and then you can just choose protect now, after that it creates a continuous backup of all your user files. You can also create a custom backup plan and choose your own folders, I know that I don’t always save everything to “My Documents”.

Copy performance was very good, average file copy was around 135 MB/s for reading and 123 MB/s for writing. This drive was also fairly quiet and didn't appear to get hot to the touch.

I’m currently using this drive as a backup destination attached to my NAS, so far everything has been running well. If I have any issues I’ll make sure to update my review.",0.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

With digital photos, games, movies, tv shows, mobile device backups, and much more to store on modern-day machines, it's nice to know that you can plug in a drive as additional storage or for redundancy of data as is my case. This drive is advertised as working with Windows 8/8.1 but it's a USB controller connected to an HDD so it will work with any machine with a USB port regardless of OS. The drive runs cool to the touch even when running my Mac OS X Time Machine backups. I also transferred 1.2TB of data in bulk between my machine and then copied all of the data onto other redundant storage --the transfer was exceptionally quick. I was actually surprised how fast the drive read and wrote over USB 3.0 since it is a standard spindle drive and not an SSD.

The unit is simple, plug it in, format to desired file system, and off you go. I've reformatted this unit 5 times now (Mac OS Journaled, Mac OS Journaled Case Senstive, exfat, FAT, and NTFS) and each iteration worked as expected.

I ran CCleaner's free space cleaning on the device and it performs as well as internal drives on most of my other machines. Would definitely buy a higher capacity drive in the future should the need arise.

A+, Seagate!
Cons: No native ability to upgrade/replace drive. I'm sure you could pop the unit open and put in a new HDD if you wanted to increase capacity or replace it with solid state storage but that's a known factor going into purchasing this unit and not worth taking away any stars.

The only real complaint I have is the size of the power plug. The transformer is enclosed in the plug itself which means the plug becomes a huge monstrosity taking up multiple slots on my power strip. Having the plug either be modular (think laptop power supply) or formatted like a slim plug adapter (eg. macbook pro charger/netgear power plugs) such that the unit would only take up one space and just would end up being tall, this would be much better.
Overall Review: Overall I'm very happy with the unit. I currently just leave it as extra storage on my CloudStation NAS which seems to be the best use for me. The CloudStation has 2.0TB as well, so this is a simple redundant drive. I would definitely recommend these units to friends and family looking to expand storage capacity on a laptop or otherwise.",0.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

One year warranty isn’t very good considering if you bought the internal drive this unit utilizes it would have a 2 year warranty.

Wish they used a regular USB type B instead of a micro type B as the micro version is very weak, flimsy and easily broken compared to the non-micro version.

As others have stated a power button would be a nice change to this device as it just powers on once you plug in the USB cable. So if it stays at one computer it’s always going to be on with your computer which may or may not be desirable.
Overall Review: Overall this external drive offers very good performance for reads and writes in a pleasant looking and small package. I would definitely recommend this drive if you have a USB 3.0 connection as it gets the job done well at an affordable price.

It is extremely quiet even while transferring files. My older Freeagent drive is noticeably louder because it clicks and then spools up...this one makes no noise at all that I can hear. As far as speed, writing a large video file to the drive using USB 3.0 port bounces between 190MB/sec and 210MB/sec. Transferring the same file back to my SATA 6.0Gb/sec internal drive it bounces between 300MB/sec and 350MB/sec. If this drive holds up, it is way faster than any other external mechanical drive I have owned.
Cons: The only con I can come up with is the USB 3.0 cord is only 3 feet long...your computer better be directly under where you place this on your desk, or it won't reach!

Seagate External Hard Drive 4TB HDD Expansion - PC Windows PS4 & Xbox - USB 2.0 & 3.0 Black (STEB4000200),260.0,4,84.99,Anonymous,Ownership: 1 day to 1 week,Verified Owner,9/3/16 21:33,3.0,"Pros: Sturdy packaging. It’s a hard disk drive, an item not well known for it’s tolerance for shock and impact. The packaging reflects this.

Clean elegant aesthetics. The enclosure has a very nice look to it and doesn’t use that awful high gloss plastic that’s only marketable use is for collecting greasy fingerprints. The single LED DOES look nice, and fits with the uncluttered look of the enclosure, but it’s positiong is problematic (see Cons).

Plug and play. Pretty self explanatory. The quick set up guide lists two steps: 1. Attach power cable, 2. Attach data cable. Up and running in about 30 seconds.

No gimmicky applications included, just a preconfigured external hard drive.
Cons: Indication LED is top mounted, rather than the standard front mount. Why even put an LED on it if it’s just going to dictate where you’re able to place the drive in order to be able to see it?

Housing feels like it’s made of very cheap plastic. Very rarely do I receive items for review that I have to give negative marks on quality, at worst, it’s a split, but this whole drive’s housing is made of some very flimsy plastic. I seriously think one major impact to the housing would shatter it. I own another Seagate external drive which is made of much much sturdier plastic, it is a year older than this one however.

Only has rubber feet to support it being stood up vertically. Maybe they want to discourage people stacking stuff on it? I don’t know, but depending on where you maybe forced to place the drive, it would be highly advantageous to not force you into one positioning option.

Running the included setup application fails to take you to the Seagate product registration page (which is where I suspect it’s attempting to take you based on the URL). Fairly easily worked around, but why do I need to do that?

1 year warranty is a joke. I started buying hard drives back when they came with 5 year standard warranties across the whole industry, a 5 year warranty today would be absurd, but I don’t see the average user using this drive up and throwing it away even inside that span. I certainly don’t think it’s OK for Seagate to throw their hands up and say “Well, we can’t guarantee the lifespan of this product for more than 12 months!”. That kind of rationale speaks volumes more to me than my other (fairly) petty gripes with this product.

On top of the above point, the drive enclosure has no visible hardware indicating how it can be opened up. Appears to be non user serviceable, in other words.
Overall Review: Some real world benchmarks. The files transferred consisted of a mix of large single archival files, and lots of small media and data files. The typical mix of things that a user would want to transfer in the real world. My computers C:\ was used for the transfers. It is a 256GB Samsung 840 Pro series SSD.

100GB transfer onto the drive at an average speed of 75MB/s over USB3.0

100GB transfer onto the drive at an average speed of 12MB/s over USB2.0

100GB transfer onto my C:\ drive at an average speed of 30MB/s over USB2.0

My final thoughts on this drive are simple: the warranty is not to be trusted. The drive I received is perfectly functional and has been working flawlessly for the better part of three weeks, but in a culture of planned obsolescense, I don’t have a great feeling about only having one year of protection for something that easily has a five year useful lifespan, minimum. I went and looked at Seagates offerings for standalone 8TB drives, and they all have the (current) industry standard 3 year warranty. Considering that, my advice would be to buy a stand alone drive and an external enclosure. It’s unforunate, because I like the all in one plug and play package, and besides my beef with the warranty, my other complaints were fairly minor. However, considering the fact I’m sacrificing two years of warranty protection for the plug and play simplicity, I would go a different route.",0.0,16.0,18.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1
Seagate External Hard Drive 4TB HDD Expansion - PC Windows PS4 & Xbox - USB 2.0 & 3.0 Black (STEB4000200),260.0,4,84.99,Brian M.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,5/3/15 13:15,5.0,"Pros: First, the basics. This is an ""archive"" grade disk in a plastic, fanless enclosure. It is not intended for gaming, video editing, high-demand NAS applications, etc. If that's what you need, just go right now and search for something else. (Hint: It's going to cost you more -- that's just how it is, you'll have to deal with that or blame yourself when you set this drive on fire because you didn't listen to me.)

This drive is a good place to put weekly backups, old DVD images that you just want to archive, maybe video editing projects AFTER they're done that you just need to store. If your application sounds as demanding as this sort of thing, then this is a drive you might consider.

The pros here are easy: speed and size. I'm listing speed as a pro because this is not an SSD or even an internal drive. This is a USB 3.0 external drive, and for my tests, under ideal circumstances, it makes good use of that bandwidth and performs as well as you could expect. The size is, of course, 8TB which is as big as these things really get right now.

Here are the test results. Parts of what is listed might be considered negative; I'll discuss those parts in the cons section below. This was all using Crystal Disk Mark.

9 rounds 100MB test:

Sequential Read: 190.1 MB/s
Sequential Write: 142.4 MB/s
Random Read 512KB: 83.6 MB/s
Random Write 512KB: 20.5 MB/s
Random Read 4KB: 1.7 MB/s
Random Write 4KB: 7.4 MB/s

This first test seemed to go haywire on the 4KB read, so I tried again:

5 round 50MB retest:
Random Read 4KB: 16.5 MB/s
Random Write 4KB: 7.3 MB/s

It was clearly a fluke, something made the drive hang on one of the nine passes bad enough to throw the average way off. It is clear that this drive struggles to do things like random R/W, especially smaller chunks. It's not designed to do that. It's a massive, inexpensive hard drive. What did you expect? Even when it struggled through the tougher tests, it didn't get too hot (36 C).

I did a few more tests just putting some stress on it.

A file transfer of about 85GB of mixed media files (music and movies) ranging from 2MB to 4GB each. This test was constrained by speed of the older external HDD source, maxing out at about 35-40 MB/s steady ideally. The transfer ran at about 25-35 MB/s for larger files, about 15-20 MB/s for smaller, with regular peaking at 50ish and 8ish.

It hit about 40 C about 5-10 minutes in, then slowly climbed to 50 C for the rest of the transfer. That's where I got a warning from disk monitoring utilities that the drive is getting close to serious heat, but not into critical levels.

The 85 GB transfer took about an hour, but as I said, this Seagate was not the bottleneck. Verification took about 25 minutes at 2.7 MB/s (that's just a read through for checksum match).

Even after an hour, sitting still and powered off, it was still at 46 C -- there is no fan, and even the passive cooling on this thing is awful.

Another file transfer, 6.6GB file copied from an internal SSD took 2 minutes, pretty steady at 100+ MB/s. This is what you expect from a USB 3.0 HDD like this.

I then formatted with encryption, the whole drive manually (including empty space). It took about 24 hours (which is typical and reasonable), and the temp plateaued at about 54 C.

Then I reformatted back to nonencrypted and loaded it up with a huge volume of mixed file types / sizes.

From a slower external USB drive, it managed 19 MB/s average (200 GB transferred).

From an internal drive, it got up to 103 MB/s average (500 GB transferred).

So it's doing fine on transfer speed, although during both of these tests, when the drive is really going for a couple hours, it will hit 55 C or even a bit higher.
Cons: So first, I'll point out that Seagate itself says its drives should not operate higher than 50 C. I think running at 55 C is probably not a death sentence or even a big worry, but it is an issue. Keep in mind, this was a brand new drive with more than adequate ventilation. Stack up a few of these, or accidentally drop a hand towel on top of it, the heat will become a serious issue.

But, frankly, this drive runs hot. If you are writing out a big set of data, doing large backups, etc. -- even tasks this drive is meant for and in idea conditions -- this drive will get quite hot. Hot enough to have a meltdown and die? Probably not. But hot enough to shorten the lifespan of the product and/or increase the risk of data loss or other issues in the future? Maybe. I guess Seagate didn't want to raise the price of drives by $5 each by putting in just a little fan or anything. That brings me to problem number 2...

This drive has a one year warranty. An external drive, put together in a nice little package, something that Seagate should be entirely responsible for. They can't back it up for more than one year? Maybe they are going to fail too often, or maybe somebody doing the actuarial tables over there thought they'd save enough money denying RMAs in month 13 to lower the price on this thing. But as a consumer, I don't care about statistics or bottom lines, I care about the quality of the goods. This warranty is just plain not good enough. The fact that the item doesn't even appear to exist anywhere except a couple online retailers. If Seagate doesn't list this product and doesn't offer much of a warranty on it, that makes me worry. I've been on the wrong end of RMAs and I think Seagate has a mediocre track record, at best. (Not that there aren't WAY worse ones out there, but I won't name names.)

The speed (see above) is not great for random R/W, particularly in small chunks. This disk is what it is -- good for archival uses. However, higher quality 8TB drives exist, and external enclosures for such drives exist. I find it hard to argue that this drive has a special purpose that justifies its less-than-average performance if the value isn't there. The price on 8TB drives is coming down, and I'm not seeing much value here, especially considering the other two points I've made (heat/bad enclosure and warranty length).

So I've listed speed as a pro and a con. It's up to you to decide how you want to split that hair. Again, it's a matter of value vs. quality, or maybe it's a bit of luck -- choosing a brand, model, size, speed, etc. for a drive is tricky but sometimes it comes down to luck when it comes to DOAs or early drive failures. If this product is the right product for you, that's good, but it might also be that some other product can do the job (or even better jobs) at a similar price. That's the ""shopping"" aspect of this that a single-item review like this can't help you too much with...
Overall Review: I had a tough time deciding between 3 and 4 stars, but I eventually made my decision because this drive is new and already seems like it's going to get made obsolete before it's even useful to somebody. Wait a month and buy something better, or put together something better yourself for an extra $20. I don't see this drive becoming a staple of people's desktop PC tech before it's already too slow, unreliable, or unnecessary compared to better options, which are already creeping down into the same tier of affordability. That's -1 egg.

The other -1 is for the warranty, not just because such a warranty automatically gets you -1 egg. Really, it's how that 1-year warranty appears in this situation. The ""optics"" if you know that new use of the term. This is a value-priced item that has nearly cutting-edge size. It comes in an enclosure that has poor passive cooling and no active cooling (and as we see, a heat issue). Replacing (or even opening) the case voids the warranty. Operating the drive above 50 C doesn't void the warranty, but it's not what Seagate recommends. So it's a little box of contradictions, and that worries me, especially given that we know it isn't the most mechanically adept device (hence the low speeds on the random R/W 4KB chunk tests). And, to be honest, the DOA reports I see when I look at reviews in aggregate make me think that the -1 for insultingly short warranty period says something about how little Seagate expects you to get out of these drives. For a drive that might serve as a backup, keep that in mind. Back up your cat photos here, and when it dies, your PC will survive long enough to get a replacement external HDD. Don't back up critical stuff. And let's be real. We all have 8TB of cat photos, right? Maybe that's just me.

If I could, I'd give it 3.5 eggs, because together, I don't think these two issues are worth a full egg each for -2. There's enough good going on here that it's better than the average 3-egg review I might give. But I can't say it earned a full 4 eggs. (Shouldn't egg-based reviews be out of 6 or 12? That's how I buy my eggs.)

Newegg EggXpert reviewers like me receive this item for free, so keep that in mind. We try to keep our reviews honest, and I hope this one has been honest. This is an item that's trying to split the difference between low-budget consumer needs and hitting that nearly-cutting-edge mark of 8TB. That's tough, and you can't blame Seagate if this isn't a perfect product -- if you buy this, you aren't willing to pay for the most perfect item out there (which would be some sweet $600 8TB drive that has stellar support, great QC, 5 year warranty, and an extra $90 for the most awesome external enclosure that exists). There are other options, with Seagate or otherwise: You can always try Seagate's other lines (e.g. ""Backup Plus"") which now also come in 8TB. Or buy a Seagate internal drive (""archive"" grade or regular) and throw it in an enclosure.

But for the price, if you think this works for you, and you've read my review (and others) and think you want to go for it, I wouldn't recommend against it. This drive could very well be what you need. Just be sure you've thought it over, because it's not general purpose and it may not be up to the task (or might be too much of a rolling-the-dice situation in terms of quality). That's for you to decide.

Keep in mind we EggXperts also can't wait too long to review. I'd love to run this product hard for a year and let you guys know that it lasts long, but I've only had it for about 20 days. For all I know, every single one of these lasts 100 years ... or maybe every single one dies on day 21. Longevity is very unpredictable for products that are new to the market or are hitting new high marks in size, speed, etc. (or low points in price).

And if you're wondering about this ""line"" of drives, you can always uncheck the box that says ""Item Specific Reviews"" and you'll see all the ratings for this drive in every variation (in this case, in every size). For some things (e.g. headphones that come in different colors), this is a MUST when you want to read reviews right. For these drives, it gives you a good idea of how reliable or good the NON-drive parts of this product are. It won't tell you about this 8TB drive though, which itself is VERY different from its 2-5TB cousins.

Oh and one final thought -- the software that comes with drives is, and has been for 20 years, totally irrelevant. Don't even bother. Some of the diagnostics are mildly useful, but the backup software etc. are not worth your time. If you are serious about backups, you need to pay for the software separately. Don't make your decision based on what comes with the drive.",0.0,15.0,17.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1
Seagate External Hard Drive 4TB HDD Expansion - PC Windows PS4 & Xbox - USB 2.0 & 3.0 Black (STEB4000200),260.0,4,84.99,Kevin D.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,9/15/16 23:18,5.0,"Pros: HD Tune Pro Read (4 MB Blocks):
Minimum: 82 MB/s
Average: 143 MB/s
Maximum: 188 MB/s

In real-world file copies, I'm seeing about 190 MB/s read and 170 MB/s write, which are very impressive for an external hard drive.

While powered on, the drive emits a low humming noise when the disk is spinning. During reads, there is no noticable extra noise. However it does make the traditional churning sounds while writing. On the whole, this drive produces the typical amount of noise for most external HDD's -- it's no quieter or louder than usual. However, given the capacity (5 TB), the noise is much more impressive.
Cons: The rubber mounts are placed along the width of the casing, so the drive stands vertically. It seems like a strange way of positioning the case, since it can be easily knocked over. Mounting hard drives vertically is perfectly safe, though. Just make sure the enclosure is stored somewhere secure otherwise it could fall off your desk, shelf, etc, and break. Storing the drive horizontally might work fine, but vibrations through the case could cause extra noise.
Overall Review: The included power adapter is about 5-feet long, the included USB cable is slightly shorter around 3-feet. Both are adequate lengths and props to Seagate for not skimping on the cables. Too many companies bundle mini-cables in these situations and it can be very frustrating.",0.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Fast data transfer with USB 3. The drive itself is very light and quiet. The drive case has a pleasant appearance, which is nice if you plan on putting it on your desk. The drive does not get excessively hot (> 50C), even with extensive use. It comes with a 4 foot USB 3 cable.
Cons: Perhaps the only real negative is the fact that it is a little bit expensive, although not for a drive of this size. 8 GB is on the high end of portable drive capacity. The other thing is that it is a 3.5” form factor drive, meaning it needs an AC adapter, unlike 2.5” form factor drives, which can be powered from the USB port. One additional minor complaint is the AC adapter itself. It will almost certainly take up more than 1 spot on your surge suppressor/power strip (up to 3 on mine).
Overall Review: I used the drive to back up every computer in my house, and it functioned perfectly. On computers with USB 3, data transfer was super fast. USB 2 is a little slow, but that is not the fault of this drive. With a USB 3 connection, I was able to back up some computers (including a full drive image) in less than one hour.
In benchmarking, the drive compared well with internal SATA drives when plugged into a USB 3 port, and the temperature never exceeded 45C. High drive temperatures have been somewhat correlated with premature drive failure. Of course, putting the drive in an enclosed space with no air circulation would make it run much hotter.
Overall I would say that this is a really nice portable hard drive and I would recommend it, mostly due to its massive capacity, portable size and excellent performance (fast and quiet).",0.0,7.0,8.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

5TB
Compact Size
USB 3.0
Cons: USB 3.0 Micro B Connector
Overall Review: The Seagate Expansion 5TB USB 3.0 3.5"" Desktop External Hard Drive is relatively small as it is just slightly larger than a standard 3.5"" internal disk. The drive has a flat black finish with a triangle/pyramid texture on the two large sides. The bottom and back of the drive have triangle passive vents. The USB 3 Micro B and power connections are also located on the back of the drive. It is unfortunate that the drive uses Micro B for the USB 3 connection instead of USB A connection, which adds compatibility along with feeling less flimsy. When powered on and plugged into a computer, the long single blue LED becomes visible on the top of the drive and blinks for activity.

Windows 7 and 8.1 recognized the Seagate Expansion drive automatically as it is formatted with NTFS. There were no auto run prompts for included software. The only data included on the drive was Seagate hardware registration, which was simple to complete. After completing the registration, I removed all data from the drive which left 4.54 TB of formatted space.

When concurrently copying over 3 TB of data from multiple disks to the Seagate Expansion drive, the average write speed was 112MB/s. Copying data from the Seagate Expansion drive to the computer averaged a read speed of 120MB/s. The drive itself was warm to the touch while data was being copied but not hot.

I recommend this drive for anyone looking for a large USB 3 drive that is small in physical size.",0.0,2.0,3.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

* Inconspicuous Design
Cons: * Only a 1 year warranty

Overall Review: The Seagate STEB2000100 appears to be a solid offering from Seagate. Packaging was good. It has a plain exterior which blends in and the LED light is not to bright. There is venting that allows for decent cooling, I personally never saw over 45C temps during testing with extended file transfers.

Performance is very similar to my 2TB Seagate internal drive. Pushing a couple dozen large 8-12GB files, both drives sustained average 95-105 MB/sec transfer speeds.

Data Transfer: With use on my desktop PC, the data write speed was 101MB's and read at an okay 171MB's. For an expansion drive for a PC, is a decent but not incredible performer. When used with a TV DVR, you are at the mercy of the DVR, so speeds will be very slow.

Impact resistance: Has no issue with a drop from 5 feet while running. Wouldn't recommend repeated drops as the first damaged the corner.

3.0USB: Should be a requirement for all drives.

Plug and play: Both PC and DVR recognized the drive instantly and had no issues writing and reading.

Quiet and cool temp: Not always easy to find in a drive, but the Seagate doesn't get too warm and is VERY quiet.

Compatibility: Can be used with a PC, Wireless Router and DVR.
Cons: Weight: The heavy inflexible internal frame that supports the drives and the thick plastic outside, make for a large heavy item, that could be much thinner and lighter. Very old school protection setup for impact. The use of urethane or silicone foams would provide far better protection and make the product not feel like a unstable brick when on its side.

Too large in size, again, there are cheaper and better ways to make the product smaller.

Power: The drive needs its own power supply due to how many drives there are, being not able to use just a USB connection.

Cannot be used with a MAC!!! MAC drives always cost more.
Overall Review: Most of the time the drives is used for the DVR for recording movies and TV shows, and it performs flawlessly every time. I also use the drives to plug into my wireless router to record security system footage on to.

Warranty: Would be nice to have a longer than 1 year warranty on a storage device.

Great for backing up your large files and images. Not as fast as some but for the $$ its perfect. getting 175Mbps (avg) read/writes as I back up or copy files from my ssd to the Seagate 8TB expansion drive. I have not noticed the heat issue others have spoken of at all mine stays nice and cool to the touch. No issues at all getting Windows 10 Pro to recognize this drive and allow access to it immediately. I have been wanting to setup a plex server for my video files I think I'm going to try and do it with this drive. As I haven't messed with plex yet I'm not 100% sure if this drive is compatible with it or not but I will know soon.
Cons: About my only complaint is that its a little clunky sounding when its in use. Nothing horrid or disconcerting but it is noticeable. Its not the dreaded click clack of death sound just the heads parking or what not in the enclosure make it sound louder is all. And the power brick on the plug is another minor issue some will find. I have a huge power strip with ample room between the ports so it wasnt that bad for me.
Overall Review: I'd buy this drive with my own money if I had to. Its perfect for what it does. Its not ssd fast nor does it proclaim to be. Its a spinner disk on USB 3.0 you wont get much faster than 200Mbps it most cases.

Seagate External Hard Drive 4TB HDD Expansion - PC Windows PS4 & Xbox - USB 2.0 & 3.0 Black (STEB4000200),260.0,4,84.99,Kenith H.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,8/28/16 15:43,3.0,"Pros: I have this setup as an expansion with no additional software. I am running on system with SDD as my main drive and using this as my mass storage device. I am using the built in backup for windows and a full backup with a disk image took about 1 hour 20 minutes. Nothing to brag about but not bad either. Backup size was over 50gb and took just a few minutes more to complete than doing a backup to an internal hard drive.

Read speed is decent on USB 3.0. Write speed is a little slow but still not bad for a USB drive. My other Seagate Expansion is faster, but then it does not have nearly the storage space this drive has.

I do a lot of imaging and replacing hard drives on desktops and laptops. This is perfect for holding the images. I also have full images of all my system drives for all my computers. Again, more than enough space.

The thing I like most about USB hard drive storage is I can power it up only when I need it. I can copy all my important files and images and then set it aside and have peace of mind knowing my files will be there when I need them. By powering off when I do not need it, I expect it will last quite a few years.

I continue to find more uses for this drive since it seems like almost unlimited storage for me. Have tons of emails now and I have started to archive all my email and store it out on this drive. Also moving my VMs to this drive - haven't noticed a performance difference running a VM on this external drive vs. running on internal hard drive.

There are just so many things you can do when you have this much storage available. Just a decade ago, the monster drive was 1TB or 2TB. Never dreamed of having this much storage at such a low cost.
Cons: Nothing really bad to say unless I want to get picky. The link to register is broke - should have been checked - small QC issue but it says a lot about the company. No fancy software but you really don't need any with Windows 7 or Windows 10.
Overall Review: Some benchmarks. Nice read speeds but write speed on smaller files suffer. You will notice the slower write speeds if you copy or backup a lot of small files. Write speeds on files 4K or less was under 30MBs. Larger files copied at speeds nearly equivalent to internal drive.

It really hasn’t beefed up in size any! May even be a bit smaller! Only an inch and half wide with a depth of slightly under 7 inches and height of 4 and a quarter it’s like a small book. Wish I looked at the specifications page on newegg before I pulled out my tape measure. Would have saved me some time there!

With 8TB, this is a great way to protect multiple PCs in the house. It’s as fast as one can expect from a mechanical disk drive and I’d say that I averaged around the 120MB/s range for my PC. This is a great choice till they come out with multi-terabyte solid state drives or sticks. Because of course, at that time people would rather watch their files backup 200x faster or more which mechanical drives wouldn’t be able to compete with. So if you’re in the market for a large storage device, this may be the last one you buy! Next ones may be SSD! Next ones may be SSD Flash drives! If you can get 8TB flash storage with 1.2GB/s transfer speeds, you’ll be laughing at this at that point! But for now it does the job!

Control over the LED is nice. The case design is really nice in my opinion. Not 100% smooth like an ipod where it slips out of your hand like butter, but not a horrible design. It’s diamond side panels makes it comfortable to pick up without any issues. It’s a very simple case. USB plug and power port is it. I didn’t even know it had an LED till I plugged it in.
Cons: The included software was useless. I tried doing the register product which led to a broken link and the software closes not letting you do anything else. A manual search on the Seagate site shows a bunch of software to choose from. However, I had to open another window to search information on what Lyve was for example. Clicking them in download just downloaded them. All in all, not a very good first impression for new users. In fact, I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone because I’d have to also explain everything to them to support my recommendation. If the company can’t make it simple enough for my friends to use, I learned to keep my mouth shut.

Now I tried this again in Chrome as I’ve learned that using a different browser can often provide different results. Then I tried Edge again, and somewhere I made a mistake because now the Lyve and driver for support on MAC and such have disappeared. Apparently I found a downloads page with more options? If you choose “Support / By Topic / Downloads like I did the first time, you get a bunch of options that don’t have much of a description. If you choose “Support / By Product / Desktop External” you come to a page where you must choose what kind of drive you have. Expansion Hard Drive and it is simplified. This just makes me not even want to use any of their software.

The Lyve choice where you are able to access your media in original format on any of your devices sounds a bit interesting. I like how with the paragon driver offered on the downloads page, you would be able to plug your drive in a MAC if yours is formatted for PC and vice versa if it isn’t. Very handy if you tote this to the family reunion to share videos and you still have those family members using the opposite platform than you! However, the SeaTools keeps freezing up when it goes to scan the USB. I rebooted the computer, tried a different USB port, and it still froze “Not Responding” on the USB scan. I’m willing to bet that the reason may be the Western Digital drives I got plugged in and I am not going to unplug them to check. If Seagate doesn’t play well with others, then Seagate will just be used differently.
The only thing I got working is the Seagate Drive Settings which the only function I get from it is testing the drive and turning off the LED. (The sleep setting I actually set within windows power management advance features. But for those that don’t know their way around windows THAT much because those settings are a pain to find, this will help keep your drive from powering down. “Which I turned off because when a drive powers down, it usually locks up the computer on me when I try to access it.”
Mechanical Hard Drives are just a big pain in the rear with all the extras! It’s best to just use this to back things up and then unplug it. When we get SSDs this big, they should work the way one would expect. As for now, too much work to get something working the way it should.
Overall Review: Some may say Pro and some may scream Con that the top is solid and not vented like the back.
Heat rises and it would be a great place for heat to escape. But a vented top may also make for quicker death if someone was to accidently spill liquid near it. Tomatoes ; tomato, as long as the drive stands up to time, who cares where the vents are placed. If you care that much, stand it on its face and let the heat rise up the back and top with that placement and you’d have that nice blue LED staring right at you!

You shouldn’t move or pick up the drive when it is plugged in. The disk spin so fast you can feel the g-force within! I love hard drives and I enjoy testing them, but I am at the point where the same problems and same software issues are getting annoying and old. Solid State drives will be replacing these like CDs did cassette tapes. I think I am done with mechanical hard disks.

I wanted to give it 4 stars because it's 8TB... But the whole idea of a desktop drive is to backup up your stuff. The software that was suppose to make this happen has failed. It's brand new and they had a broken link to registration. They only offer a 1 year warranty where others offer 3 to 5...

It has a cool black color and geometric patterns on the case, it is relatively thin for an external drive, and in my opinion it looks great on the desk rather than detracting from the look of the desk.

After doing some speed tests, I was impressed with the drive’s overall speed. I was able to sustain speeds of over 30 megabytes per second (~240Mbps) even when moving large files (I tested with a 16GB file of all 0’s from dd).

The drive is very quiet, so it’s not cumbersome leaving it on if that’s your plan. After being left on for a few weeks, the enclosure is not hot on the outside, so I feel comfortable leaving this plugged in long term as well which is ideal for a backup drive.

I have a very large file server and this 8TB drive is the first drive large enough to be useful for me for backups as a single hard drive. I am planning on mirroring my most important data from my file server to this drive for safekeeping. With the drive being so large, it should be useful as a backup drive for any individual, maybe even for multiple computers at a small business. 8TB is a lot of storage!
Cons: I have not found anything negative about this drive so far. The speed, overall performance, and design are great. Hoping for a good run with this as my backup drive!
Overall Review: The last Seagate external hard drive I owned, which was also an EggXpert review item, actually failed in less than a year. I will be keeping a close eye on the longevity of this drive and I will report back if it fails in an unreasonably short amount of time. A second chance is definitely earned since this is a much larger drive and inevitably contains some new technology. Hoping for a better run this time from Seagate.",0.0,7.0,82.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

I have always preferred Seagate drives but then began to have some issues with reliability and having to RMA some of my drives. Now Seagate seems to have figured out any issues they may or may not have had.
Cons: The dreaded power brick. This drive has it. It uses up an outlet and blocks one possibly two others. They are annoying. They are unnecessary. Companies should stop using them. I don't even care how but they need to definitely work on getting rid of the on plug power brick.

Overall Review: Do yourself a favor, get another usb 3.x enclosure if you need an external drive. The one attached to this drive is firmware kneecapped. And shucking this thing is simple popping the plastic off and removing 1 screw. Nothing else.

Speedy ""burst"" write speeds, but only for small write tasks. See Other.
Cons: Very slow random write speeds - dips down to 10 MB/s or worse for large transfers even with write caching.
Cheap plastic case with little ventilation.
Overall Review: I purchased a bunch of these over the past two years and they've been running nearly 24/7 with no issues. Hard drive failures do happen from defects, but this is rare. Far more often heat is the killer. If you do not have an active cooling solution for this drive while writing to it for an extended period of time, then it will either disconnect from your system and require a restart or the drive will fry itself.

I highly recommend doing the following before writing any important data onto the drive:

1. Hook up the drive and turn on disk write caching in Windows disk management.
2. Place the drive on its side and point a fan into the bottom vents.
3. Do a FULL format on the drive with the highest allocation unit size.

If disk write caching is off then your write speeds can plummet to 10 MB/s or worse. The full format will take nearly an entire day to complete, but if the hard drive is defective then there's a good chance it will fail the full format or your subsequent file transfer, in which case you return it and get a new one. Having a fan blowing into the vents while writing to the disk all day is MANDATORY. Make sure the disk is reporting temperatures no higher than 50C or you will have problems.

These enclosures used to come with Seagate Archive drives in them, but that changed to Seagate Barracuda Compute drives in the summer of 2017. Both drives use SMR technology rather than traditional PMR, which is why the random write speeds are so awful. The newer Barracuda Compute drives have improved SMR with additional caching that allows them to sustain longer ""burst"" write speeds to help offset the poor random write performance, but this only lasts a few minutes at best.

In short, sequential writes to the drive are nice and speedy (100+ MB/s) provided you have active cooling. Random writes should only be done in short bursts or avoided altogether. The drive is also a good economical choice for mining hard drive based cryptocurrencies like Burstcoin.",0.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Runs cool & quiet*** See Other Comments below
Cons: Non so far
Overall Review: I bought this drive in 08/2018, so it's been 9 months now. I took the drive out of it's stock case and put it into a Mediasonic Probox running with the USB 3.0 connection and it has not failed. It is not the fastest drive on the market but has a good enough transfer (write) rate between 80 and 120 MB per second, depending what else I'm doing on my PC. Speed was not the concern when I purchased this drive as this is a storage/backup drive only, my main selling point was the Seagate name which I exclusively use for all my spinning HDD's which I've had some of them for 15+ years, and the sale price of $139. The drive runs cool and is not noisy at all. I cannot comment on how the drive runs or performs in it's original case as all I did in the original case was spin it up and format the drive to make sure I didn't have a DOA drive.

Cons: The drive is not designed to lay flat as my previous Seagate Expansion drives do... I prefer to stack the drives due to limited space.
Overall Review: This drive copied large image files at 165MB\s for the first 25% of it's capacity, then 150-155 MB\s through the middle 50%... By the time the drive was down to it's last 25GB the speed dropped to 90MB\s...

As normal, the speed was slower when copying a large number of small files..

Because this was going to be a lengthy test at maximum speed, I placed the drive flat in a more normal position with a small external fan blowing into the vents on what would normally be the bottom...

The drive never exceeded 100F during this period, and was normally around 95F... Just slightly warmer than the internal drive that was providing the images..

I will be putting rubber feet on the drive so that it can lay on it's side permanently and be stacked with two other Seagates... Appearance wise this is not the ideal situation, but functionally it will work better, plus the vents are more available to cool with a fan if needed under heavy use...

The Seagate STEB2000100 *does* come with its own external power supply. It does *not* rely on the USB cable for power. (For those who are wondering, that's a requirement for Dish Network compatibility.)
Cons: No cons. I suppose no matter how good a mechanical hard drive is there will always be some duds, but the two I bought are working flawlessly.
Overall Review: I hope Seagate keeps making these. Dish Network boxes won't recognize external drives over 2 TB (I assume because of the problem that older computer BIOS have recognizing larger drives).",0.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Response from Seagate Support re the Server2008/Win7 Backup 4K Sector Issue:
I understand your concern because the Windows Backup utility is not compatible with drives using 4K sectors. It is correct, we do not offer a utility to convert a drive from 4K to 512e. The incompatibility is an issue with the software and one that Microsoft chooses not to fix until later releases of the Operating System. If you are concerned about compatibility with the native backup, I would recommend our newest line of Expansion drives. These units are 512e out of the box, for customers who have Windows OSs, with the backup utility that could not save to 4K drives.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have since deployed these new series Model STEB2000100 2TB units on a Server 2008R2 system, they are 512e and the built-in Windows Server Backup is working flawlessly. Also, I have just purchased a pair of the 3TB units Model STEB3000100 (as I presume they’re 512e too) for another 2008R2 system and if I encounter any problem with those & Windows Server Backup I will update this review accordingly.",0.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

There's enough space on this drive to copy everything from all of them, so I can gradually eliminate copies of copies that have been spawned in an effort to keep ""legacy"" information from work and home.

- I've been able to play games from the thing while backing up about 1TB of content from another external 4TB drive. The USB 3.0 speed is very good unlike other external drives I've tried which barely support large capacity drives.
- It arrive in about a day and a half after ordering (I live on Vancouver Island, Canada).
- Packaging was easy to open and yet perfectly secure. NewEgg's inflated bags are eco-friendly which is rad.
Cons: - A bit of plastic packaging in Seagate's box that wasn't truly recyclable or necessary, which means even if you recycle it, it'll end up in a landfill.
- The box claims it's only compatible with Microsoft's Windows. Untrue, ExFat has been supported by Mac OS for over a decade.
- Incorrect information about Linux compatibility- Linux can format the device and interact using ExFat if necessary (would recommend EXT, BTRFS, ZFS instead).
- Smartmontools does not work with this USB External HDD. Seagate uses a specific driver set for their USB device unlike generic enclosures and most compatible HDDs.
Overall Review: - Would totally recommend, got it on sale for a great price and it shipped super fast.
- Performs really well compared with other external drives.
- Supports more than they claim, don't be shy as a UNIX / Linux user.
- Somewhat concerned that there's no SMART Support, however APFS or a similar File System are aware of hardware changes and have built in features for reliability.

These drives are noisy, and at least in my experience very unreliable. The money saved is a gamble if you only have a 50% chance of keeping your data...
Overall Review: Seagate RMA is relatively hassle-free, provided they have stock to replace your model with.
The older model that laid horizontally on your desk had a much lower failure rate for me, maybe 1 in 8-10. Perhaps the vertical orientation of these new units is causing premature failures.

I only put DVD rips on this drive but it hasn't got a single smart error after a month of use. If you do use it internally, you can reuse the exterior case with a different hard drive.
Cons: For internal mounting the drive doesn't have the right number of screw holes. it is missing two in the middle. Not a problem if you can mount from the bottom though. If you do reuse the external part with another drive, it likely wont look as pretty when you are done because the cheap little plastic tabs prefer to break rather than bend when prying it apart.

- The drive inside appears to be a Seagate Archive series, which are not suitable for many uses.
Overall Review: Be aware that these are SMR disks, and as such are unsuited to many workloads where data is modified in-place or written in small chunks.

Overall Review: I previously reviewed the 8TB Seagate Backup Plus drives. I am happy to say there have been NO failures of the 21 drives in 9 months. I recently needed to upgrade my 'Movie' computer and bought 6 more drives. While I did not encounter any failures, I was disappointed. I didn't notice that Seagate markets the external 8TB drives two ways, the Backup Plus and the Expansion packages. I'll focus on the differences noting that the actual drives are IDENTICAL. However, the warranty on the Expansion drive is only 1 year while the Backup Plus is 2 years. If you want to remove the drive from the enclosure and reuse the enclosure, say for the drive being replaced, the Backup Plus is MUCH more friendly to disassemble and reuse (as-is or just using the frame sitting on a desk to temporarily connect a drive to a computer). The Expansion enclosure will be nearly destroyed and the SATA3 to USB3 adapter is taped to the drive as there is no frame.

Overall Review: Keep your boxes for the warranty return, you might need them. I bought two of these drives to use for media storage since I knew the drives would be slow, but large that didn't bother me. I have one dead after a month or so of use, I returned via Seagate warranty. (I had to pay to ship to them) and the warranty replacement drive didn't even last a day. Don't waste your time, they're cheap for a reason. I'll be sticking to WD from now on like I should have from the start, but the price was too good at $140 on sale with a coupon code, don't make my mistake. Just look at the other reviews. I wasn't doing anything crazy with them or transporting them around to physically harm them either.

If you are going to get these...fully test them with a full format (takes days) and write some test data to it a few times, and then do a full test with Seatools (hard drive test tools for Seagate).",0.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

I have a 2-year old external drive with USB 3.0, and this Seagate drive is 2.5 - 3 times faster. I averaged over 100 MB/sec on recent transfer of large video files (vs. around 30-35 MB/sec with old drive).

Cons: One died just after 30 days, of course.........
Overall Review: I bought 2 of these not long apart.
The first one I bought, which has hardly anything on it is still going.
The second one I bought came with a different power supply than the other, which leads me to believe it was actually a refurb.
Of course that is the one I had written over 4 TB's of data to.
I bought it on 4-25-15 and it died on 6-2-15, not long after the newegg warranty ran out.
I have my data backed up because I didn't trust these without some time behind them.
Good thing.
Now I worry if I have to buy back ups for my backups.
Not sure if I should expect the other one I bought to fail also.
I have used seagate drives for years with almost no failures.
Had a couple fail recently.
I may have to start looking for another storage solution.
Really super disappointed in the one that failed just beyond warranty.
Especially as it shipped in the same box as the other bought less than a month apart but with a totally different power supply.
I gave it 2 eggs because one of two still works but I am now afraid to write data to it.

Overall Review: I have 7 Seagate Expansion USB 3.0 HDDs in my Windows 10 Storage Spaces pool of drives which runs 24/7. I have had no problems with 6 of these drives, but 1 drive is constantly losing connection with the computer. I have to disconnect the power cord, then plug it back in, and Storage Spaces brings it back online. No data has been corrupted, but for some reason, the drive just goes off line every 2-3 days. I usually buy these drives when they go on sale, but the 1 year warranty is not very long and now I am buying other brand USB 3.0 HDDs with 3 year warranties for about the same price as the Seagates. If you look at the life cost of TB per years of warranty, Seagate Expansion drives end up costing more with only 1 year warranty.

Cons: Transfer speeds below 1 MB/s, probably due to power supply
Overall Review: So I am confused by this drive. I own several USB 3.0 external drives that I can plug in an run diagnostics on and get pretty consistent results. However, when I plugged in these new drives (I bought two), right out of the box they were giving me less than 1 MB/s write speeds, and maybe 3MB/s read speeds, give or take. Then I swapped out the power and USB cable from a different seagate drive and get a nice 160-180 MB/s both read and write. So I think the drives are ok, but the power/USB cables they provided are bad? I did try switching out the USB cable they sent, and got decent results (120 MB/s) so I think it is the power unit that is the likely culprit. It's too bad, because I was really excited about these, but with all the time I've had to waste trying to figure out what's wrong, I probably would have been better off going with a different product.",0.0,8.0,10.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Cons: The drive ships with a UK power supply so Newegg includes a UK to USA adapter which you then must ""stack"" on to the AC side of the power supply which causes the supply to sit 2 inches away from the AC wall receptacle. This causes the power supply to become unstable and it tends to fall out of the AC wall receptacle on the wall. I purchased two of these drives and both have this issue. It is very disheartening to be streaming a large amount of data only to have the process interrupted by the power supply falling out. They need to include the proper power supply or stop selling these as is. I just purchased another desk top remote drive and I went with Western Digital because of this problem.
Overall Review: I would have given these drives a ""5"" if it were not for the power supply problem. As I said earlier I bought TWO of these and I can't even swap supplies to have at least one reliable drive. I am very disappointed.",0.0,7.0,9.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Actually, it's the fastest large capacity USB 3 drive I've ever used. Burst speed when copying small amount of files, is around 140MB/s. Copied 4.5TB (about 3000 mixed files) from a Toshiba drive to this drive in about 12.5 hours. Sustained speed never dropped below 100MB/s, which is very impressive. Speed is around 110MB most of the time.

Temperature is average. After copying 4.6TB data, drive temp is 51C (Hard Disk Sentinel). For comparison, the Toshiba drive temperature is 61C. It's hotter than warm, but not too hot.

Noise level is average.
Cons: Cover blue light indicator; it's a little too bright for me.
Overall Review: The only concern at this time is longevity. The drive is a new model, and seems to be SMR drive. We just don't know how reliable the drive is. I took advantage of Newegg sale, and bought two of these drive. They backup each other. Just in case.",1.0,5.0,7.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Cons: The first one had a large bad sector, so was returned for replacement. The second one had a large bad sector, so was returned for replacement. I had to go on holiday, so the third drive had to be cancelled. I am now back ready to order yet another drive, to see if it has a large bad sector. After I return that one, I will likely just keep ordering these to see if any good ones were built.

Cons: Durability. (will update review once I have a replacement drive and test for a few weeks to a month.
Overall Review: I have had good luck with Seagate products in the past, both internal & external. I saw this newer version of the Seagate Expansion 5TB become available and at a great price so decided to order though no review history was available.

After initially testing the hard drive with Seagate Dashboard software as well as a quick Seatools diagnostic pass and having the drive pass, I connected the drive to my Synology Raid and configured it to backup 3.7TB of data. After starting the backup, it made it about 15% of the way through and then the blue light started flashing and it disconnected from the Synology, stalling the backup and forcing me to perform a hard disconnect of the device. I connected the drive to a machine and ran it through the same set of diagnostic tools which barely recognized the device and was never able to make it through testing again. The drive lasted a total of 2hrs before dying.

Thanks to Newegg and their excellent staff, I have a replacement drive on the way and am hopeful this was a rare occurrence. I'll update my review once the new one is up and running for a short period of time.

I'm always fearful of having a single massive drive to store files on (this is why I use RAID) and this experience proves the point. There is no substitute for having a good backup. This drive is to be used simply as a standalone backup for my Raid setup in case of catastrophe and I'm not too comfortable trusting the drive for this purpose based on my first experience. I will be performing a full multi-hour test on the next drive before putting it into regular service. If you plan on using any drive of this size and use it as your primary storage drive without backing up, you should purchase a data recovery plan to improve the likelihood of recovering your data in case of problems. In my case, I just need the drive to work and hold my backup data, so I purchased an extended warranty for 3 additional years of coverage which is well worth the small additional cost ($20).",0.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Marketing promotes the space as a base 10 value which is not a lie or misleading, but appears that way for those less educated in how a computer represents memory (including harddrive) space. For a computer it is base2. So 2 to the 10th power is 1024 and that is what a computer uses to convert bytes to Kbytes to Mbytes to Gbytes to Tbytes. So when a computer represents something in Kbytes it is divided by 1024 instead of base 10 dividing by 1000. If you take the 5000000000000 and divide by 1024, you get 4882812500 Kbytes. Divide it again by 1024 and you get 4768371 MBytes. Divide it again by 1024 and you get 4656 GBytes. Divide it again and you get 4.54 TBytes (suprise suprise suprise it is the value you are all quoting when you are stating it is short space). So you are getting every last bytes that is listed in Base 10 it is just that your computer is showing it in Base 2. Don't believe me, make you computer display your drive capacity in Bytes instead of TBytes and you will see.
Cons: See Pros for a quick lesson on capacity representation on a computer. Others have corrected misinformation about the connector so I won't go on about that.
Overall Review: I own the older version of this drive and love it. I am in the process of purchasing the new version and see people are still complaining about getting shorted on space when they aren't and giving 1 egg because they think they are right when they are actually wrong about the point they are making. This drive looks great and I hope it can also operate horizontal (foot pads and such) as the drives tend to last longer in that orientation.",1.0,4.0,5.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

The drive also comes with a USB cable and it has a small footprint on my desk. In other words, it is a small drive that comes with the hardware you need to install it, reads/writes fast enough, and stores lots and lots of data. On the surface a great drive, please see cons for the whole story.
Cons: The drive has two big cons.

First, it makes very loud clunking noises and the clunking creates vibration. In fact, the clunking creates vibrations so strong that they make my keyboard keys vibrate. My keyboard is located about 18 inches from the drive. I am using the drive with Plex Media Server to stream my video collection to my TV. The drive clunks continuously through each video file that Plex is streaming.

Secondly, the drive makes so much noise and vibration that I am worried about how long the drive is going to last. When you combine that worry with only a 1 year warranty you can understand my concern. I do not trust this drive to last very long.
Overall Review: I would not recommend this drive to others. I give it 3 stars because so far it is working.
I do not trust this drive to be a secure backup device. I am going to have to buy another 8TB drive from a different manufacturer soon in order to backup this drive so I can be confident that I am not going to lose my data.",0.0,3.0,4.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Cons: This drive seems to be very unreliable. Many 1 star reviews for failures.

Only lasted 3 months.

Lost 3 1/2 TB of files.
Overall Review: ORIGINAL REVIEW 07-01-16:

This drive worked good for about 3 months and then just died while transferring a file to it. When powering up, it would click twice, pause, click twice and shut down. Worked with it for about a week, powering it up and it shutting down, when finally my computer recognized it.

I was able to use SeaTools for Windows on it and do the SMART test, which it failed. Did the Short DST and it passed. Did the Short Generic and it failed. Tried the longer tests and the drive locked up.

I was able to transfer some files off of the drive, but now the drive is dead again and just clicks.

I have had other Seagate drives with no problems, some over 10 years old that still work fine. This is the first Seagate to fail me. This drive seems to be a dud and would highly recommend staying away from it.


UPDATE 07-06-16:

Just got off the phone with Seagate support. I did the advance replacement where they ship the replacement drive to me first and then I return the bad drive using their packing material. There was a charge for this service, but I asked why I should have to pay for replacing a drive that lasted only 3 months. They waived all shipping charges.

We regret to hear about your experience with the Expansion Desktop drive. We’re sorry you’ve encountered this circumstance, however, we’re hoping to lend a helping hand and offer some assistance which may resolve the issue. From what we understand, the drive transfer speed was slow and it failed after 5 months of use.

In your situation, we would suggest the following:
• Try connecting the drive to another port on the computer (ensure it’s connected to a port directly).
• You may also try using a different cable.
• Verify if the drive detects within Disk Management (on PC) or Disk Utility (on Mac).
• Try connecting the drive to another computer to see how it reacts.

Performing these steps can rule out a problem with the drive itself. There can be situations where the problem is related to other things which can affect the drive. Please follow the troubleshooting steps in the link below:

https://www.seagate.com/as/en/support/kb/usb-external-troubleshooter-003581en/

If the issue persists, please create a case with our technical support team using the link below so that we can further investigate and explore the available options:

Seagate External Hard Drive 4TB HDD Expansion - PC Windows PS4 & Xbox - USB 2.0 & 3.0 Black (STEB4000200),260.0,4,84.99,Juan C.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,10/2/18 17:44,1.0,"Pros: 5tb Size - was priced at good deal (at time I got 1tb internal drive basically free after promo costs/etc)
simple design
Cons: Ok as I stated in previous Review - the Mini B 3.0 USB plug - is prone to breaking internally. any amount of up or down flex of the USB cable can easily break the internal connector.
the Short USB 3.0 cable that comes with it barely let me put it next to PC, before the cable caused it to break.
I have since purchased a much longer USB 3.0 to USB mini B 3.0 cable. Why they didnt use the larger USB plug Ill never know - as the case has plenty of room for the standard USB plug
Overall Review: I ended up with an RMA by going to Seagate support - this was before I noticed their reply to my review.
I did a advanced RMA - which cost me about 13 USD for them to mail me a working drive, then I return old one in the box they ship me.
I got a different model in return (sea gate back-up plus model) same 5tb space/usb3.0 new in box as replacement.
Then I come and notice they replied to my Review with a code to enter on there website - but ""nowhere"" do I find a place that lets me enter that code - when I tried in couple places - it failed to work. So i don't see the point in there response if I cannot enter the code, to get the offered assistance from them.

Seagate has really fallen over the years. Never again.
Overall Review: Do your research and test these drives when you get them. I had a second one as a spare and when I finally needed it, it was worthless.

There may be a variety of reasons for slow transfer performance, as it is not typical or expected for this 5TB Expansion Desktop drive to experience this problem. Make sure the drive is being used with a high-performing USB 3.0 port directly to a port on the computer (not on a USB hub). Also, please verify that the latest USB chipset drivers and Windows updates are installed for your system, as not having the latest drivers and updates can cause the symptoms described in your review. Please reference the following support article for more details:

Tested the drive with SeaTools, the Long Generic test failed in 6 minutes.. a test that should take about 14 hours to scan the entire drive, must of been pretty bad.
Overall Review: I understand that hard drive failure rates are high these days, for that reason I would highly recommend buying hard drives locally. Get it home, run a long test on them before you do anything with them. if they fail, take them back and get a new one immediately, no sense in playing this Russian Roulette with our data.

Cons: 1st drive failed, resulted in Blue Screen of Death; had to RMA and ship it back.
Overall Review: The Defective Drive
I ordered one of these drives, received it, plugged it in, and started backing up data to it. Within 10 minutes, it crashed my system via a Win7 BSOD (Blue screen of death.) I have never once received a BSOD in 7 years of using Win7. The hard drive was definitively defective, and unreliable for data backups.

The Customer Support
I contacted NewEgg, got an RMA number, and they paid for the shipping to California. They sent me a new drive (same model, same brand, same storage capacity.) So far the new Seagate 8TB is working fine.

Looking Back:
Lesson to be learned? Buying hard drives is a Guessing Game. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
I have another Seagate external (4TB) that has been working well for a couple years. I have Western Digital drives (external and internal) that work well too. There's no way to know you'll get a defective unreliable brick until you plug the thing in and start sending data to it.

Would I recommend this drive to someone else? No.
Does that mean that a person buying this drive is likely to get a defective one? No.

Cons: Overheats on sustained writes
Only 1 year warranty
Overall Review: I have a number of these Seagate USB HDDs in my Windows 10 Storage Spaces pool of drives. In general, they work well in that environment. I bought this drive to backup data. During a large 4TB data backup, while plugged into a USB 3.0 port, the drive overheated and went offline in less than 20 minutes. I restated the transfer and again, in less than 20 minutes, the drive was offline which I believe was due to overheating. The transfer rate plugged into the USB 3.0 port was about 80-90 Mbps. I decided to plug this drive into a USB 2.0 port, the transfer rate dropped to 30 Mbps, but the drive has been running and writing data for the past 20 hours without going offline. I imagine these drives work well in my Storage Spaces pool of drives because the data is not written continuously to any one drive, so it probably bypasses the overheating issue I see when used a standalone drive backing up large amount of data. I have been buying these drives because the cost per TB is better than other options. In my Storage Spaces environment, they work well and I can lose any 1 HDD and the data is still OK. But the 1 year warranty is not very long, which indicates to me that Seagate does not put much faith in them.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

This is a LOT of storage space for a very doable price. Seagate makes a good product and although I am usually a Western Digital fan first, I have grown quite fond of these Seagate expansion drives for storage.
Cons: They are a little big, but that may just be my complaint. I am more fond of the smaller and more portable drives but I use these primarily with my desktop and for that purpose, they are perfect.
Overall Review: I would highly recommend these drives if you are looking for something for a primary storage drive that you are going to leave in one place or rarely move. There are cases available for almost any external hard drive but the size of these makes them rather cumbersome if you are looking for something to move. If you are just looking for external storage, the price and quality are hard to beat.",1.0,3.0,7.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Decent read/write speeds, so far 650GB of data in a little under an hour or so from a slow internal 5400rpm drive.

USB 3.1 write to drive speed of 170~175MB/sec
USB 3.0 write to drive speed of 125~130MB/sec

USB 3.1 read from drive speed of 175~230MB/sec (depends on file size)
USB 3.0 read from drive speed of 150~200MB/sec (depends on file size)

So far three test writes have netted the following:

1st test - 650GB backup write (mainly photos 30.4MB/each) in 57 minutes.
2nd test - 1.2TB backup (steam library, various file sizes) in just shy of 1 1/2 hours.
3rd test - 3.5GB backup (my documents, localized data) in just under 5 minutes.
Cons: Micro USB 3.0 cable feels like cheap plastic wrap, the drive does not come with placable feet tabs to install on the side you wish to be the bottom. The LED light is on constantly when idle, I'd rather have it completely off til activity so I can tell when activity is happening.
Overall Review: I would recommend this for long term storage where you only backup once in a while and only access the data once in a blue moon. Product is solid and does the job and as the Nvidia CEO says ""It Just Works!"" It's definitely going to be a new staple for photo backups in the future.",1.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

I had to buy it in order to try and rescue data off of an 8TB drive that went flaky at about 5 months.

It fails the sea tools test So it remains to be seen if I can rescue the data. At any rate I have everything I need to to send it back and see if I get double trouble on the replacement.

Cons: Noisy, bad case design leading to heat death, Slow and errtic read/write speed
Overall Review: Ok so the reason everyone lokks at these are that the $$/GB is the best for these drives. I have used the older designed expansion cases of 5TB and they were MUCH better. The new case itself is just plastic with holes on TWO sides (older case had a aluminium sheet around the drive which acted a heat sink with holes at bottom as well which worked great to keep them cool). When copying 3.5TB the drive died due to heat which was above 50C (I placed in a zip lock bag and put it in Freezer and it revived). Even when working I was getting randomn speed spikes after 2-3 minutes of copying which is very odd. I had two drives and both showed the same symptom.
I finally copied 3.5TB to one drive but it just died with a week. In panic, I opened it up (void warranty but I needed my data back as I had deleted my old drive data) and placed it into Freezer again and it started up again and managed to recover in 2 days! slow copying speed for reading but it was the erratic at best. I am now using one as a internal drive (only fot backup after 1 week) and one as a backup to a NAS (in case but with a small fan on it when I was making the first backup as this heats up fast).

Please spend some money and buy a good NAS or Desktop drive . This Archive drives were good before (my 5TB one is still going awesome) but the 8TB one is just a bad drive which will kill your data and with 8TB it will make you be sorry for trying to save $40.",1.0,3.0,9.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

I am guessing this is for use with a mac, as a place to store the NTFS driver and seagate software. this can be a problem , when your old drive was mounted to a folder as sda1 and you plug this drive in and it configures its self as the first hard drive so sda1 is now an unreadable file system. it caused my Raspberry Pi to crash when booting. this only happens if you've configured drives to mount to a folder in the configuration files, and not when you're letting it auto mount, Linux ignores it during auto mount.",1.0,3.0,9.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

Seagate External Hard Drive 4TB HDD Expansion - PC Windows PS4 & Xbox - USB 2.0 & 3.0 Black (STEB4000200),260.0,4,84.99,Carl S.,Ownership: 1 month to 1 year,Verified Owner,9/13/15 9:06,5.0,"Pros: My experiences with Seagate drives: I have gone through 40 or 50 drives in various systems over the last 10 years. I have been very price concious, having too little money to spend on equipment. These external drives are usually cheaper than the equivalent internal drives, sometimes by a significant amount (30% or more).

First, I always take them out of the external case and put them in a proper case with a fan. They run near or above 50C in their external case and usually around 30C in a good case. I love the Vantec 4X cases, but they are harder to come by these days.

I have had many 3T drives, most of which have failed after 3 years or so (still, 3 years isn't too bad). I still have a few 3T that I want to replace ASAP.

I am having very good luck so far with the 4T drives (almost 4 years in on some) and have a few 5T, 6T, and 8T which seem stable.

I've had a number of WD drives also, and I don't see any significant diff. in the lifetime.

Either I've been very lucky, or taking care of your drives really does make a difference.
Cons: I wish I could just buy the internal drives. Its such a waste to throw away the plastic.
Overall Review: I suspect some people's trouble could be the cheap USB interface they use, not necessarily the drive itself.",0.0,2.0,5.0,7.0,17.0,1,1,1

The first 2, great drives, passed diagnostics, took a full format and into service they went. They get 5 stars, however this one only gets 2.
Cons: Now this one has me worried, while it passed diags, it won't take a full format. And I've tired. Today is the second full day, yes 48 hours and this thing is still in the middle of a NTFS format and it's not even 50% completed. This is consistent with the other times I've tried on this drive.

There may be a variety of reasons for slow transfer performance, as it is not typical or expected for this drive to experience this problem. Please verify that the latest USB chipset drivers and Windows updates are installed for your system, as not having the latest drivers and updates can cause the symptoms described in your review. Please reference the following support article for more details:

http://goo.gl/t6ASqf

Also, reboot your computer and try the drive on a different USB 3.0 port, if available. Make sure the drive is used directly to a port on the computer and not on a USB hub.

If you are transferring many small files, this will take longer than transferring an equivalent capacity of larger size files.

If this does not help, or you have additional questions or concerns, please contact our support staff directly and we will be happy to assist further:

- The drive seems to stay spun up for about 30 minutes after last access, which is fine. My Samsung D3 Stations all spin down after 1 minute. I think the frequent start/stop cycles aren't so good for hard drives.
- Speed is good. Maybe 80-110 MB/s sequential. Variation is normal depending on whether the I/O is at the outside or center tracks on the platter.
- I have 4 total, 2 about 8 months old and 2 about 2 months old. No problems so far.
- Long 47 inch USB cable. (Probably4 feet if I stretch it.)
Cons: - I like to format (scan all sectors) new drives to hopefully find any problems while still under warranty. The format was terribly slow. Unplugging and reconnecting the drive seemed to fix it. I saw this with at least 2 of the 4. I don't know if I connected the USB and power cables in the wrong order or maybe since it was the first time Windows had seen the drive, it brought it up in USB 2.0 mode.

Cons: A 1 year warranty for a drive of this stature is laughable! Seagate should be tucking their tail between their legs when they issued it. The bigger problem is that I purchased 2 identical drives for a NAS archive. The part number and serial number of both items are identical! Part numbers, I understand but how can both serials be identical? How would Seagate manage is authorized warranty and who isn't?

I looked it up and both my units warranty expire Dec 17 (which is a little more than a year). I have no idea what to make of that and have to wonder if these drives are counterfeit.. Will I be supported if one of the drives fail? Both drives fail?

This is a well balanced drive and read and write times do not tell everything. It does everything very well such as mixed reads and 4k. Compare other things other than read and write times to higher priced drives and you will see this is a incredible value. Thanks WD for being a value leader.
Cons: Nothing comes to mind.
Overall Review: Folks nobody gives you screw for a M.2 drive so please stop complaining about that. This is not the fastest drive out there for read and write times. Runs cool without heatsink even under a big graphics card . Heat spreaders are cool for about five minutes until they get buried under a graphics card. Incredible value for a 1tb M.2 drive and was a nice step up from a older Intel 530 M.2 drive. Purchased a PCIE card and cloned the drive in about three minutes then transferred to motherboard and renamed to C . Most add on cards will need a SATA cable so keep that in mind if you go this route. Did not reach 2400mb/s speeds on box but I did not expect it to with six other hard drives in my system.

- Fast!!
- Cool, don't see it get close to throttle point.
- WD Dashboard software is actually well built and useful.
Cons: - But not the fastest, at least on paper.
Overall Review: I'm thinking there's almost no reason anymore to go SSD. Sure, their price per GB is still considerably higher than mechanical drives, but I feel it's compensated by the fact a lot is now being pushed to cloud and streaming services. No more movies, music or photos on the PC anymore.
On paper, the SN550 is far from the fastest. But in real-world usage, it doesn't matter. If you look it up, you'll see that for general system performance, gaming or even light to moderate productivity, SATA SSDs to all the way to PCIe 4.0 nVME drives perform extremely similarly.
Why nVME then instead of a cheaper SATA SSD? Cables... got rid of a whole power cable from the power supply, and a SATA cable. And it's now all attached directly to the motherboard... CPU, RAM, hard drive... easier than ever to migrate. Lazy... but it's a plus!",0.0,3.0,3.0,15.0,57.0,1,1,1

- Western Digital has a drive transfer utility on their website, which was very simple and easy to use to move my old primary drive's data to this one.
- The drive was new according to statistics from power on time and number of boot cycles. All health checks passed.
Cons: - Make sure to read your motherboard's manual before installing an M.2 drive. Some ports operate faster than others, and some disable certain SATA sockets when used.

Not system reviving / Earth moving fast, but noticeably faster than my Intel Sata3 SDD. The SSD benchmark I used (AS SSD) says it's 5x faster reads, and 10x faster writes. It's within spec of marketing material.

-Windows 10 went from 22 seconds for full boot on Sata3 SSD, to 13 seconds on NVME. Mostly noticeable during updates, which seems to be never ending these days.

-No cable, easy install. Less cables is more better. I am particular when it comes to cable management so having one less is always nice. I'd trust a novice builder to install one without issue.

-Cheapest NVME option on the block, by a reputable company.
Cons: -Not a con, just preference. Some may not like the blue PCB. My hardware colors are blue / white and silver though, so it matches ok. If it really annoys you, heat sinks are a thing, but they would probably push the cost up towards a 970 EVO / WD Black. I think it looks better IRL than it does online so take that for what it's worth.

-None at this time. Will update if any issues arise.
Overall Review: -Would definitely recommend to HDD users if you're looking for better overall system performance, SATA3 users if you want more capacity. The difference in speed vs SATA3 SSDs isn't worth the cost unless you're upgrading for more storage capacity as well. Everything is noticeably faster loading, but it's not as impressive as going from HDD to SSD.",0.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,57.0,1,1,1

Install took a few attempts to nail the X4 mode via pcie adapter (mobo m.2 was limiting to X2 mode and half the speed).

Steps used to migrate win10 from old drive to this one:
1) Boot Disk cloned via Acronis WD software
2) used MBR2GPT.EXE (comes in win10) to convert disk from MBR to GPT/UEFI (necessary to boot from NVME drive)
3) Used minitool partition software to resize the partitions on the NVME disk

Overlooked Western Digital, don't know why, but the SN550 finally caught my eye. Glad of it. I thought I needed a 1T ssd, but realized the 500G will suit my simple desk-top computer machine just fine. I replace a 256 G Intel 760p, which is a tough act to follow...I ran 'Disks' benchmark on my Fedora 32beta and it gave me 3.4GB/sec. reads on the SN550. Which is far above specs., don't ask me what's happening there, I'm technically stupid. Anyway, highly recommended. And of course, 1T version was on sale the next week, but no regrets.

Runs at advertised speeds after doing some benchmarks with it
stays cool under load but I DO have a well ventilated case so your temps may vary
Cons: may cause frustration for a beginner new to the nvme tech or just pc troubleshooting in general
needs more clear instructions on how to initialize drives and extend partitions in windows 10
Overall Review: I will start by admitting I'm that n00b. This is my first nvme drive but I was cloning from my sata ssd boot drive. I just wanted to have the latest and fastest speed for my OS while also expanding the space a bit more. my boot drive has gone from hdd > sata ssd > nvme now so i assumed it would be the exact same process as before. I didnt know that you had to manually extend the boot drive partition so you could utilize the whole drive space. So for those trying to expand your boot drive total space and speed by going with nvme once its plugged in make sure you first allocate your drive size by initializing it through creating a new simple volume on the drive then cloning it through something like Macrium like I did so you dont end up creating your smaller drive size onto the new nvme and thinking you messed up and lost out on drive space. You can also fix it if this has already happened to you with Macrium. There's a great youtube tutorial if you look it up. Hopefully this can help someone out with the same issue I had. Other than that ( which is obviously a user error) this drive works GREAT and does exactly what I expected. Very happy with the end result.",0.0,5.0,7.0,15.0,57.0,1,1,1
Western Digital Blue SN550 NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2B0C,181.0,5,59.99,Mark N.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,6/27/20 17:02,5.0,"Pros: If this is your first m.2. drive, you, like me, will be amazed at the sheer size of it. Thankfully, I kept the mounting screws that came with the motherboard I bought (as this package does NOT include them and you WILL need them to secure it). I highly recommend a magnetic-tipped screwdriver because the screws are so small and if your case is like mine, you don't have a lot of room to work with. That said, once it's installed, you won't need to take it out, so it's a one-time challenge that is doable.
Once installed, you may need to tweak some settings on your motherboard. After booting up, be sure to activate it through disk management (e.g. create partitions, assign drive letter). I couldn't figure out why it wasn't showing but was recognized through device manager (user error lol). I've since cloned my O/S drive to it and it's been working well without any issues since.
Cons: It really isn't a con, but I personally can't tell a vast increase in speeds compared to my old (2015) Samsung SSDs. That said, Crystal disk confirmed the specs of it being about 4x faster (in ideal circumstances) than a regular SSD on a SATA 6GB connection. I think it's something you are more likely to notice when copying files to it and doing other tasks, like video editing, multitasking, etc...it's still a GREAT addition to a computer if you've a) run out of places to put a regular SSD and/or b) you are looking to upgrade from an older HDD. I bought it thinking my older SSD could die on me (being 5 years old - but it actually has a lot of write cycles left still) but a great addition as a games/o.s. drive for anyone.
Overall Review: I'd recommend it. It was a great price for the speeds, size, and type of drive. Plus, WD isn't a no-name brand and have a good reputation (I have HDDs from 2012 which still run perfectly fine). For me, that was very important, as I'd rather pay a bit more for something with quality and reputation than something where I might save a bit of money but then ""pay for it"" down the line.",0.0,2.0,3.0,15.0,57.0,1,1,1

The Mobo settings were set on auto, did not need any adjustments.
Benchmarked the drive with crystal disk and a few others. Results were usually slightly above the advertised values and sometimes even beat the ones in reviews.
Anyway testing is good to make sure you didn't get a lemon, but synthetics only go so far.
Windows loading time is very snappy as well as any file transfers. The best part are the games. Some only had barely noticeable improvements, but games with lots of loading screens/high drive use became notisably better. Specifically Mount and Blade 2 Bannerlord is much more enjoyable due to shorter loading times, which happen multiple times a minute during gameplay.
Highly recommend as a system/select games drive. 5 eggs.
Cons: None so far. I guess it would be nice to have a heatsink on the drive, but I haven't had any issues or temperature spikes (according to the hwmonitor).

Overall Review: To clear things up for those convinced they absolutely ""need"" this: you don't.

I will say the same goes for PCIE 4.0. You will only see a difference in load times. This will NOT make you a better gamer and your reaction time will NOT improve. You will NOT become a faster graphics renderer or video editor.

What this will allow you to do is load large files and applications up quicker. Extensive video editing programs like Adobe Premier and CyberLink PowerDirector will not be bottle-necked when manipulating large HD files and will improve your productivity in that way. So if you're a mediocre video editor, you'll remain a mediocre one, just a slightly faster one.

As for gaming, again, load times is where you will see the difference. The increase in gameplay framerate is negligible - meaning an ""improvement"" of 1-2 frames on 157fps on ultra settings from a conventional SSD is meaningless.

An if you're playing on ultra settings, you're not a competitive gamer. You're a just another player.",1.0,2.0,15.0,15.0,57.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I decided on the P100 to replace my son's old Antec 300. We wanted something that would accommodate his large new Asus DCII R9 290 graphics card, provide ample cooling while staying pretty quiet. The Antec P100 fits the bill and then some.

First, the dimensions are great for a mid size case. Plenty of room in the inside for large GPU's and to work around the motherboard and not feel squeezed. There is room for a 240mm water cooler up top, I test fit my CM Glacer 240L and it fit perfectly. The case can also accommodate tall cpu coolers and easily had tons of room for my Hyper 212. There is excellent routing for wires behind the motherboard tray. The included fans are quiet at both speeds, my only complaint is that there are only two of them and stock cooling with them is mediocre at best. Thankfully there is plenty of room for more and I added 2x140mm corsairs up front, moved the fans that came with the case to the 2 spots on top and added a Corsair 120mm to the back. With these in place the case was still dead silent at idle and offered ample cooling keeping the power hungry overclocked R9 290 to only 65C when 100% loaded playing Far Cry 4 on Ultra settings.

There are tons of hard drive trays and they have nice silicone bushings to keep rattling away. The slot in easily and snap in place with a nice and solid ""clack"". Also, the front fan filters are of nice quality and easily cleaned. The front door is mostly plastic and feels a little flimsy, so some care may be needed to make sure it is not damaged. The side doors have sound deadening material attached, which really does help. The top has deadening as well, but I removed the panels so I could replace them with top exhaust fans.

The case offers 4 front USB ports, 2 of which are USB 3.0, but if you have a older motherboard and do not have one of the new USB 3.0 headers, the cord has a built in adapter to plug into a normal 2.0 header! My only real wiring complaint is that the individual wires for the power button, LED, reset, etc should be wrapped together in a single cord. They all plug in near the same place on every motherboard known to man, why are they loose like that?

In the end, I am very pleased with this case. I got it for $59 after rebate and for that price it is a steal. At the normal $89 MSRP, there are some solid alternatives out there, but the Antec P100 absolutely deserves at least a look.",0.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1
"Antec Performance Series P120 Crystal E-ATX Mid-Tower Case, Tempered Glass Front & Side Panels, Slide Button Design, Ready for 2 x 360 mm Radiators Simultaneously, Aluminum VGA Holder Included",135.0,4,99.99,Anonymous,Ownership: 1 day to 1 week,Verified Owner,4/18/19 8:35,5.0,"Pros: I actually used to use Antec cases for all my builds, but after I got a HORRIBLE case from them the last time around (called the Lanboy Air Red, one of those ""open mesh"" cases that makes an incredible mess of dust and noise, had a bunch of LEDs you couldn't turn off, etc), I decided I would not use Antec again and would find something. So on my latest build I went with an expensive NZXT case and never looked back.

But, my wife needed a school computer for the kids, and I still had that older one in the Lanboy Air laying around. I decided to fix it up for her, but there was no way I was going to put it back into regular living room use with that messy, loud case. So I started looking around, with zero intention of even looking at Antec, but found I had a lot of difficulties finding a case that was quiet, had dust filtration, and still had an optical drive. Getting all those features apparently is a challenge these day.

So I decided to give Antec another look. I went on their website and saw this: a quiet computer with dust filtration and an optical drive that also wasn't a gigantic tower. And then I found out it was in the budget category at only $50 dollars! So I decided to give Antec another shot.

I'm really glad I did, because I was really, really surprised and impressed by the case. This is a high quality case, especially at this price! I doubt any other manufacturer could have done better. There are:
1. Nice sound absorbing panels
2. The PSU sits on vibration absorbing foam blocks
3. There is an optical drive, and it installs into a nice removable, tool free cage!
4. The 3.5 inch drive cage can move forward or back in the case as needed to accommodate front fans and radiators, or to give more room for power cables from the PSU (there are screws on the bottom of the case that allow it to move). It also has nice slide out chassis for holding the drives. And of course there are obligatory low profile 2.5 in drive areas also.
5. They give you four nice velcro straps to be used with plentiful built in anchor points in the cord routing space under the motherboard. This gave a lot of flexibility for routing different cables.
6. The case just looks very nice. Very high quality, nice looking finish, everything seems flush and tight, including around the optical drive, etc.

Honestly, had I known about this case, I probably would have bought the windows version for my new PC and not the expensive NZXT case. Not that I dislike my NZXT case, but then I could have had a built in optical drive and not a have to keep a USB drive around that takes up extra space.
Cons: -It would be nice to have the dust filters be removable/washable, though at this price, it's great that they are even included.
-It would be nice to have the front fan mounted at the bottom, in the lower PSU chamber, to make sure there is airflow down there. In the default position, there isn't really any other than what the PSU itself supplies (so there is none for the 3.5 inch drives). But again, this is very minor.
-It looked like they had space for a second 5.25 optical drive, so it would be nice if there was a cutout for one. I had to reduce from two drives to one when moving to this case. Given that most manufacturers have dropped the optical drive entirely, I'm grateful for what this did have, but having two is still nice for doing a simultaneous copy/burn or ripping a couple music CDs simultaneously, making multiple copies of family home videos at the same time for the extended family, etc.
Overall Review: I would absolutely recommend this case in a heartbeat. I don't think you can get a better case at this price point. This probably stacks up well with cases in the 90-100 range.",0.0,10.0,10.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

- No silly LED color changes
- Did I mention it's SUPER quiet!
Cons: - The manual could be a little better.
- Front case fans connected to a 3-position switch on top front of the case. The middle position of that switch turns the fans off. That's dangerous. That switch in top of the case is counter-intuitive, and I still don't understand what the positions on that switch mean. I took the three individual fan case connectors that were connected to that switch, and individually connected them to a managed power slots on the motherboard.
Overall Review: If you need a top tier quiet case, this one is for you. I've used quiet ANTEC cases for over 12 years now, and their products are unsurpassed. This latest addition to their quiet family is the best yet. I am extremely happy with the purchase. There is no comparable product on the market.",0.0,8.0,8.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Cons: Sound deadening materials may be slightly loose on the edges (YMMV)
Molex connection required for fan controller
Overall Review: Purchased this case as the foundation for a FreeNAS setup. Assembly of the system within this enclosure was uneventful. Cutouts behind the mounts for the 3.5"" bays make it fairly easy to establish data and power connections with the drives installed. There is less room behind the motherboard in comparison to the P110 Luce (which I also own) so a bit of time and effort will be required to route everything if you're loading this case up to the gills with storage. I equipped the 5.25"" bay with an Icy Dock 2.5"" drive hot swap enclosure to provide a total of 12 bays of storage capacity. The only thing I hear when the system posts is the initial ramp up/test of the 40mm fan on the CPU of the installed motherboard. During normal operation, you'll barely hear any utilized hard drives. While this case is much larger than traditional retail NAS units with hot swap bays, it's a pretty solid compromise when considering that the drives will receive ample airflow to keep within the desired specification for reliable operation. The lack of windows, RGB and other flair on this case make it a solid contender for builds where the focus is on quiet operation with good airflow.",0.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

5 1/4 slot for whatever (optical drive, fan controller, etc.)
did I mention roomy inside?
Has a door to hide the exposed drive bay and fans.
The top case edge is far enough away from the top edge of the motherboard that you don't have to be a contortionist (or have tiny hands) to put in the top motherboard screws.
Case is very quiet even with all the fans installed and an air cooler on the CPU. Even when I'm playing Borderlands 3 on an i9 9900k and an RTX 2080ti.
Cons: Door isn't reversible. (Why do ALL case door designs default to opening to the right?)
Case door thumbscrews aren't captive.
It's HEAVY (not really a con, I guess since it's not supposed to be portable)
Wiring spaces behind back panel could be deeper.
More cable management tie-downs would be nice.
No included Velcro tie downs for cabling.
Overall Review: I bought this case after feeling very cramped in a build in another case which also had pretty inadequate cooling when I finally got hands on. This case, though, has plenty of room inside and has good airflow to keep things cool.

Cable management is doable in this case, but some rubber grommets on the cable pass-through holes would be a plus. So would a deeper space behind the back panel and more tie-downs.

This case keeps even a high-end rig nice and quiet and still lets it stay cool. I would compare this case favorably (for my needs) to the Be Quiet Silent Base 800.

After trying to cram my rig into a Corsair Carbide 100R, this case was a much better build experience. And my rig stays cooler in this case.",0.0,5.0,5.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

The screw kit was good, with an extra here and there. Also, they seem to have fixed the issue with P280 where the drive bracket screws were too long. Friction brackets for CD ROM drive were very easy to use.

No gaudy LED or window nonsense. Excellent foam insulation on the sides.
Cons: Lots of fan holes, not a lot of fans. This is kinda disappointing, but the top fan holes are blocked by a sound dampener, which works well. Temps are good even without multiple case fans, so I'm leaving it as is for the lowest possible noise.

Another minor complaint is that the case has no 3.5 holes. No one uses floppy drives, but I have both a card reader and an extra USB3 facade that goes in a 3.5 that I can't use. Honestly I would have preferred that over so many 5.25"" bays.

Pro: As I assembled this system, this case proved to have more useful features than any other case I have used in the past including other Antec Cases. The grommeted access holes for cables are a great plus for cable management and the front panel connectors and switches are well positioned and easy to get to unlike many other cases I have used. This is also the quietest case I have ever built and the fans are well placed for good air circulation.
Cons: A minor complaint that the front panel fan was a 3-Pin not a 4-Pin but ASUS to the rescue, providing a marker on their 4-Pin fan connectors that allows a 3-Pin connector to be attached easily. Also, I personally wish the front door opened left to right instead of right to left, but that’s just a personal preference, not enough to change my 5 star rating.
Overall Review: I have used Antec cases & PSUs before but this is definitely a new level of quality and innovation packed into a nice system. It made the build much more fun and easier than some of my other builds. I am still amazed at how quiet this case is after packing all my drives into the bays and running them at top volume.

Handsome, no-nonsense case, not at all flashy.
Cons: I would have liked to see grommets around all cable holes. It is nice to have the two hidden SSD mounting spots but I don't like their placement: too close to the motherboard ports. Unless you get some very short SATA cables (2-3 inches) you will have to bend your cables and fold them into place. I would prefer the case come with PWM fans. I found it a little odd there is no HD activity light.

My biggest gripe is that I never did get the I/O shield to fit properly. I swear, I must have spent t total of 1-2 hours trying to get it into the opening snugly around all four sides and just couldn't do it. It couldn't have been my fault, it's just not that hard of a job. I could always get three corners and edges into position but never all four. I finally chose the edge I wanted to leave partially seated and had to apply a little extra pressure to the motherboard to get it to line up with the mounting holes. No biggie in the end, I finished the build, it all works, and one short edge of the I/O shield is not 100% seated.
Overall Review: ASUS Prime Z390A motherboard.
Core i5 9600K CPU and a Noctua NH-U9S CPU cooler.
2x8GB of Ballistix Elite RAM
I used an nVidia 1070 Ti video card.
I bought two 140mm Noctua PWM fans for the front and a Noctua 120mm PWM fan for the rear exhaust.
I added nylon fine-mesh Silverstone fan filters to augment the case's so-so filters.

At idle, the CPU runs at 32-33 degrees C with the fans running at about 300-400 RPM so cooling is not an issue at all. When gaming, the CPU runs up to the high 50's C with the fans spinning up to 800 or so RPM so heat is not a problem there either.

"Antec Performance Series P120 Crystal E-ATX Mid-Tower Case, Tempered Glass Front & Side Panels, Slide Button Design, Ready for 2 x 360 mm Radiators Simultaneously, Aluminum VGA Holder Included",135.0,4,99.99,Adam C.,Ownership: 1 day to 1 week,Verified Owner,11/19/18 6:56,3.0,"Pros: In looking for a small and professional-looking case for a business environment, this one stood out for the clean and unassuming design, in a reasonable size, and not-outrageous price. The tool-less 3.5"" drive trays also looked like a decent feature. The price was out of what I consider to be ""budget"" case range, but I figured that additional features like the easily removable air filter and the ""sound-absorptive foam"" on the side panels might be nice.
Indeed, it does look professional. There's plenty of flexibility for mounting 2.5"" drives. I didn't have any issues attaching my components- a microATX board, 2x SSDs, and 1x 3.5"" HDD- and there's still room for additional drives. However, I expected more durable materials for the money. The power LEDs work, and the USB3 ports also work fine. I have yet to test the audio ports in the case. The included fans work, and are quiet, but are also low RPM and don't move buckets of air. They're fine for the system I built, which will draw less than 150w (for the whole system) at full utilization.
Cons: First, the plastic on the front of the case is very soft and easily scratched- if you accidentally run a fingernail across it with some pressure, it will leave a mark. In moving the case from one room to another after assembling the system I somehow ended up with a gash on the front. The paint on the metal seems pretty durable, but that front plastic is soft enough that it's going to look beat up after a while even from people casually brushing by it when they walk by the desk.

The claim that there is adequate space for cable routing is tenuous- while it's nice that they include some cable ties and holes in the back plate for routing cables through, there wasn't enough space between the back plate and the case side panel on the back plate side to squeeze in a 20-pin ATX power cable. The tool-less drive trays attach to the drives such that the connectors face the back plate- which doesn't make much sense because you then have to remove the other side panel in order to cable them up. Thus, the trays actually make it more difficult to get drives attached. The direction they mount in only makes sense when the drives plug into a pre-wired backplane, which isn't the case here. The included screws are not of expected quality. It's nice that they're black to match the case, but I found one that was flat on top (the space for the driver bit hadn't been formed), and noticed that the longer screws for attaching the board to the back plate wobbled when turned as if the head of the screw was not centered. Finally, plastic-body thumb screws- I know this is perhaps nit-picky, but I've had much cheaper cases come with more durable all-metal thumb screws. It doesn't feel like these plastic-body ones will last.
The included mesh ""air filter"" has pores too large to catch most dust- unless you have monster-sized dust particles. I used the extra space to insert a second layer of filter material, cut from a sheet of air-conditioner-prefilter (which is very cheap and reasonably effective).
Overall Review: The last Antec case I built a system in was a Three Hundred- a case that was in the same price range, and similarly business-looking- the ""fit and finish"" of the Three Hundred was better than this P5. I'm not sure how effective the foamed panels are at reducing noise levels, as the system I built is fairly quiet to begin with. I expected a bit more for the price, and given my previous experiences with Antec.",0.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Silicon-grommet drive trays w/SSD mounting holes. Nice aesthetics. Not a fan of doors, but this one opens wide, has a nice mag-lock and doesn't rattle around.
Cons: Went to this from an Antec Solo, largely to accommodate a regular-size GTX 760. The P100 is lighter/thinner, and lets a little more noise out. (It's still reasonably quiet, though, and while the panels are thin, the overall feel is not flimsy).
Overall Review: Stock fans run about 1200rpm at high, and are fairly quiet. Didn't move enough air at low. Haven't added a third yet, but temperatures are noticeably improved over the Solo -- CPU, GPU and 7200rpm drives are all running a few degrees (C) cooler.",0.0,3.0,3.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

No fancy bling
Lots of room inside, especially if you remove the drive bays (which was easy)
Heavy duty construction
Cons: The LED Antec logo on the front is extremely bright. I quicky disconnected it to shut it off
It is quite heavy due to it's solid build. Not really a con for me because I don't plan to move it around
Larger than average, but this could also be a positive, considering your need
Overall Review: I didn't want my latest build to be decoration for my room. I needed a quiet case to unobtrusively sit in my living room next to my tv.. . something that will be easily ignored when not in use, yet always ready to go.

Cons: See overall review below.
Overall Review: So far the air flow seems adequate.

However I do not recommend this case.

Routing power cables is difficult - especially routing power and data cables to the SATA drives. The construction of the drive cages makes connecting multiple drives to a SATA power cable a real chore. Connecting SATA data cables require nimble fingers. The location of the cages also make routing power and data cables to the motherboard and power cables to the graphics card a challenge.

If you will use this case under a desk, be sure there is enough room for the connector portion the USB connection on USB cables and flash drives; they add about 1.5 to 2 inches. The USB ports are vertical, not horizontal. The same applies for the audio connections. I purchased separate 90 degree USB adapters to allow use of two of the four front USB ports with flash drives and USB cables.

I have been using Antec cases for about 15 years. This is the first one I am sorry I purchased.

The P100 I purchased a few years ago for my wife's computer was a much better choice. I wish it had been available from Newegg at the time I purchased this case.",1.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

The front face is very nice looking with the dark sleek brushed aluminum. Plenty of space on the inside for hard-drives and wire routing, etc. It is also acceptably quiet.
Cons: When the case arrived in the main I noticed something rattling around inside the case. I opened it up to find the fan mounted in the rear had fallen apart. The bladed part was completely detached from the rest of the fan housing. It went back on fairly easily and to my surprise was very quiet. The front fan however, makes a very quiet ticking sound. Because of this I am running the front fan on the low speed. The rear fan can run at full speed and is still very quiet, but the front fan on high becomes quite noisy. I may replace it with a different fan.

Another thing I noticed was the cheap feeling quality of the case. The sheet metal feels very thin and the removable fan filters fall off very easily.

Because of these two reasons, I am taking one egg off, but overall I feel this is a very good looking case and still worth the price.",0.0,2.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,0

Sleek look

Enough room to manage non-modular psu cables decently.

Works as expected for this budget.

Ample enough drives for an mATX case.

Construction is solid enough for price point.
Cons: Large, non modular PSUs can be difficult. My unit was just under max length as stated in the specs, but I had trouble both fitting the drive bay and my bundle of unused cables. Modular PSU would be a wise choice in this case.

Fans aren't pmw.

Drives audibly vibrate a bit in the tool-less bays, an easy fix is to put a rubber band around the drive before inserting it, such that only the rubber touches the bay.

Airflow is garbage. I don't see this as a super bad thing given that airflow is something you give up for ultra silent operation, but know what you're getting in to.

Maybe this is my bad eyesight and small phone, but from the pics I was under the impression that the front panel had square perferations all along it's sides. In reality, only the bottom 1/5th has perferations, and the upper squares are filled in with plastic. Good for noise, bad for air.

No extra thumb screws in the bag. Don't be a dummy and lose them.
Overall Review: Egg taken off was for airflow. Though most people should know there are always airflow and heat concerns for builds in these sorts of cases, Antec doesn't do enough to warn the user. I'd hate for a kid to finish his first build only for it to die early because of suffocated, hot components.

I had to slightly underclock my GPU (rx480 8gb) and CPU (r5 1500x) to get an acceptable mix of low idle temps and low noise. If you are willing to make these sacrefices for silence, buy this case. It's great for a silent browsing/work computer that can game at the end of the day. Most of my cons were pretty minor and manageable. If you refuse to sacrifice performance just buy something with a mesh front panel.",0.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Everything is beautifully arranged, there are holes everywhere for running the cables through. It's a solid steel case, yet I haven't discovered any sharp edges anywhere. Motherboard mounting holes are clearly marked and they include a pack of screws and mounting hardware so you don't have to scrounge. The hard drive mounts can be removed. (I took out one of them so I could run some cables.) Air Flow is great for this case, which is surprising by how well it blocks the computer noise.

This is easily the nicest case I've ever used. It's well designed and looks sharp. They really got this one right.
Cons: None. Just a couple warnings: It's very heavy. The size and build quality translates into a really heavy case. Not something that should be moved often.

Right angle SATA connectors can't be used for the HDD connection cutout on the back of the motherboard tray
HDD trays require screws and tools to install 2.5"" drives
HDD trays are a little flimsy
Overall Review: I would recommend this to anyone needing space for many hard drives. The trays are simple plastic so do not require any hardware to install, yet do have the ability to screw in the drive. They are flimsy, but that makes replacements cheap and lightweight.",0.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Cons: Not a bit deal for me, but for some workstation/server boards, where multiple SATA ports are lined up in two rows on the side, connecting SATA cable to the first row (closer to the board) will be tricky. The cable comes up from the bottom section (separated by the metal box where PSU is nested) and then has to pivot through an opening that is in the same place where the SATA ports on the board are. Again, this can be an issue only when using full size ATX server or workstation board of high end with multiple SATA placed on the side in two rows.

Doesn't have a hole for a support for the lower right corner of a 9.6x9.6 board. (not a big deal since it's just a support, not a ground)
Overall Review: The fans are so quiet because they have such low airflow. Had to leave the side off for my CPU to quit overheating all the time. (with the side on, it breaks 100°c in under 5 minutes of gaming, with the side off, it never breaks 90°c) Will be replacing the fans with something that gives a bit better airflow.

***UPDATE 7/2/2019***
Replaced case fans with Arctic P12 case fans. Just as silent as the stock fans, but with better airflow at the same speed, and the ability to go much faster.

Ryzen 5 2400g with a GAMMAXX 400 (2x Arctic P12 fans instead of the stock fan) and a bleeding-edge stable overclock of the iGPU, stays under 86°c no matter what, and the acoustic impact is effectively nil.

Purchased a second one of these for another system, and used the two 140mm front fans on it. They may only be secured with a single screw apiece, but it significantly improves airflow, and is still silent.",0.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Everything fit in with room to spare. Cable management is excellent. Stock fans are quiet and keep the case cool with plenty of air flow. Its nice to know I can install additional fans if required but so far I haven't needed to. I've been buying Antec cases for over 15 years and I would highly recommend. Its not fancy looking but it does the job!!

I really like the the cable management and the level of unrestricted airflow has helped the temp of my current processor running temp drop by 15°C , 55° C to 40°C, using standard fans. I was considering a water cooler before purchasing this case.

This is the perfect case for you. The front door is secured via a magnet and has a filter as per norm. as well as a small vent on the bottom of the door to allow plenty of air. The case has lots of room on the side panel for cable management and lots of room for after market cooling.

Low-key appearance, almost elegant
External drive bays
Status LEDs, power button, USB ports all accessible without opening door
Inlet air filters
Semblance of acoustical treatment
Decent cable management
Liquid cooling capable
Cons: Thin metal, not up to the build quality of my last Antec case, for example, it is easily noticeable that the top is not flat
Acoustical treatment too light in weight and is not very effective ...case still rings if you thump it
No speaker for boot trouble codes
Only two external drive bays
Internal drive bays are not modular, for example, no way to remove a RAID array as a unit
No tactile feedback from power button, hand to find in the dark
Reset button right next to power button, no way to tell them apart in the dark
No external USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports
Included fans are not PWM
No provision for running a single fan on top
Internal drive carriers are plastic
External drive bays have screws on only one side and drives move when touched
Bottom air intake for power supply is impractical on carpet
Stamped air grill on top looks cheap. Undoubtedly the result of wanting to support liquid cooling, but for anyone who doesn't want to do liquid cooling, it serves only to compromise the appearance and functionality of the case. Personally, I' much rather see support for a single 140mm fan, as that would probably out-perform the two 120mm fans that come with the case.
Too short for my taste
Overall Review: The trend towards cases without external drive bays may make sense for some, but it also impacts less obvious uses for those bays, like cards readers, controls, displays, and all sorts of stuff that external drive bays can be used for. Speaking for myself I would rather have my drives and readers mounted instead of cluttering up the top of the PC and/or my desk.

I was really sorry to see Antec resort thinner metal. How much extra could it cost to make the case thick enough so that I can't dent it with my thumb? And why the cheesy acoustical foam? The door on my previous Antec case closed with a thump, almost like a car door. This one closes with a rattle that then rings the rest of the thin sheet metal case. And I suppose this is a matter of opinion, but I think I might be willing to sacrifice the wire management for a thinner profile. It's handy to be able to stuff the cables out of the way, but at the end of the day, my build didn't look or work any better than it would have without the extra compartment, and it kind of takes away the value of good craftsmanship. It reminds me a little bit of the phrase ""sweeping it under the carpet"".

Even now, as I sit here looking at this new Antec case next to my 10-year-old one. The new one is shorter, fatter, less elegant, and just geneally less appealing than the older one. I think the new one will work well enough, but it's just not as ""nice"".",0.0,8.0,9.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

My build went smoothly and the case is well designed. The external 5.25 drive bays are tool less and the internal drive slots include rubber grommets for hard drive anti vibration. There are plenty of available fan slots for gaming rigs and the case is very quiet with the included fans set to high. Each included fan comes with a high/low setting. I purchased one additional fan that easily installed to the front of the case for intake (Antec TwoCool 75246 120mm 2 Speed Case Fan). This fan is identical to the two fans included with the case. There is ample room, under the mobo, on the right side of the case for cable management. My power supply came with numerous cables and I was able to fit all of them under the motherboard tray and still get the right side of the case cover on without issue. The package also includes enough additional screws to complete your build in addition to screws for the additional front mounted fan. There is plenty of room for the latest oversized graphics cards. Comes with USB 2.0 and 3.0 support. More details can be found at Antec.com.
Cons: This case has a bottom mounted power supply so if your rig sits on the carpet you risk suffocating the power supply intake fan. From what I have noticed during evaluating new cases, most manufacturers are now mounting the power supplies on the bottom of the case. To avoid the issue, I mounted my power supply upside down and with the additional intake fan, in front, I'm not concerned about heat being drawn into the power supply from within the case.

My P100 came with a minor bulge in the back of the case near the bottom. The shipping box was in good shape so I think this occurred when the metal was riveted together. I was able to fix this with a slight tap of a rubber mallet. Since I was able to fix the issue easily, I didn't take an egg off the rating or feel the need to return the case, but Antec's QA could have caught the imperfection.

Love the brushed aluminum, front, the rubber grommets bordering the excellent cable management. The Air filters are sufficient, sturdy, and easy to access, and there's plenty of ventilation even when the front door is closed. The side access HDD cage allows for an easy build and easy wire management. I like the the rubber grommets for liquid cooling hoses, and the radiator mount on the top is very sturdy- good features, particularly if you're looking for a Volkswagon Case with a Porsche engine
Cons: I just built a PC using a the Define R4 that I got for $5 more than this (After rebates). Compared to that case, this one felt inadequate. The p100 front door had some give to its structure, the side panels wont stay on unless the thumbscrews are inserted, the foam muffler was lightweight and peeling off the case, and the vibration dampeners were not very robust. The major flaw that was my deal breaker- and knocked off the 2nd egg was that the built-in Fans are 3 pin, and controlled with a 2-way switch hanging from a wire incise the case. The exhaust controller would fall into the video card; the intake fan controller is accessible by removing the back panel. PWM fans are not that expensive -I just bought one for $5- and it's an easy way to add value to a case. Most MOBO's can control them, and if you're buying a mobo that doesn't have the capability, and you don't want speedfan, you shouldn't spend your budget on a case this expensive.
Overall Review: This is a case that would be fantastic for a liquid cooled CPU or GPU, when intake/exhaust aren't so closely managed. If you're spending the kind of money needed to get the components that need liquid cooling, and the coolers for them, this case is a good way to cut cost. If you have a 4 yr old middle of the road gaming PC like mine (z77/3660K/660ti) Those features are unnecessary. I just need a good looking case because it's in my livingroom, a quiet case so that we don't have to listen to it when we're watching a movie and three fans that can be controlled by my MOBO.",0.0,6.0,7.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

The construction is definitely sturdy.
2. Solid case and a lot of special features to reduce noise.
3. Color is cool and simple. Neat finish
4. Cable management option is great
5. An added 2 fan to molex connector is good bonus to save some money (thank you Antec!)
6. Dust filter (see cons)
Cons: 1. The usb front panel connection to MB was loose causing lost of connection. Open up and it is a quick fix with simple nudge to the cable.
2. The case is not as quite as advertised. Maybe this is personal since I used all the fan ports (2 fronts, 2 top, 1 back, and push pull evo212), and R9 290x lightning at full load, Evo212 push pull for CPU. Coming from Thermaltake V3 to this P100, and I did not get the ""oh my, it is suddenly so quiet"" impression.
I had a NZXTH440 as well to try and it is quieter, albeit the temperature becomes hotter.
4. You will never have enough of the backspace cable management. More room will be great, but this is just personal. Compared to H440, this is considered plenty of space.
5. The lack of side window (personal reason once again).`
6. The lack of dust filter for top fan, as a safety feature (the air holes on the grid for the top fan is relatively big, and screws (for fan can go through it). I will switch to 2x 140mm in the top to prevent things to accidentally fall into the case.
7. The main thing for taking one star off is due to Newegg shipping. It is slow, and it is during winter storm here. It arrived with a crushed box with apparent abuse (being thrown or being on the bottom of something else). Should I blame Fedex or Newegg?
Luckily, the padding inside provided by Antec saved the case. The case is unharmed and all is good.
Overall Review: A lot of people are complaining on how te front fan panel only allowed two screws. However, the two screws are more than enough ,and the fan doesnt rattle, hence overall it didnt add to the noise mentioned above. I once thought that this case can provide quite and cool performance. It cannot do both, and neither can any case for air cooling.
NZXT H440- quieter, less space in the back and higher temp.
This case, less quiet, more space and best price for value (sale about $50)
R5 Fractal is definitely a more expensive one, but I did not get the ""oh my, it is suddenly so quiet' impression either from my friend's.

- It has good quality foam lining the sides, and four large fans. I can turn the fans to low (one front fan off, the rest at low speed) or high (all fans on, at high speed). I can also select all fans off.
- It is a very quiet case. This is much quieter than my old case.
- It is large enough to support very large graphics cards, though you may have to remove a HDD cage for the larger cards. I put in an EVGA Nvidia RTX 2080 Super with three fans. It is a large card, and required removing a HDD cage for it to fit.
- It has a large number of HDD cages. These are easily removable, and completely tool-less.
- It has a PSU shroud, and good cable management.
- I like the 4(!) USB ports placed on the top of the case.
- The sides are easy to put on and take off.
- It has dust filters, to help keep the case clean.
- It has a 5.25"" bay for an optical drive
Cons: One of the motherboard spacers stripped out.
The HDD light also doubles as the power light. It's also very bright. It's shining into my eyes when I am using the PC, and is sometimes distracting. EDIT: Shortly after writing this, a HDD failed. After removing the bad drive, the HDD light began behaving as expected, usually off, except to occasionally blink on. I think the HDD light being reversed (usually on, except to occasionally blink off) was due to the bad HDD.
The biggest downside is that the case fans use the old-style power connectors, and don't integrate into the MB. This means I can't control them using the MB controllers, or see how fast they are spinning.
Overall Review: This is a very good case. It is heavy, well built, and has 2 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0 ports on the top of the case. This, to me, was very important, as I don't like having to plug things into the back of the PC. Also, the top placement is very nice, as this sits on the floor. The top placement makes the ports easy to get at. It has space for water cooling, and for more fans, should you need them.

I have built a lot of PC's over the years (*ahem* decades), and this is one of the best cases I have used. It's not flashy, no lights or glass openings. It is very quiet, and I don't want lights or flashy. I want quiet and invisible. This is perfect for that.

Fan control cable arrived non functioning
Overall Review: I bought this case because i don't want the flashy lights, it is the right size, I wanted a strong pc that didn't make a ton of noise, and it fit my budget. This case does all of those things.
That being said, the fan controller cable arrived non functioning. Customer service number on new egg site for antec is disconnected. Antec website is error code 404. Even the local number that new egg customer service provided me was disconnected. By all intensive purposes, Antec doesn't exist if you have a problem. I needed 9 standoff screws for the Mobo attachment, it came with 6. It also came with 0 screws to screw into the standoffs. Newegg made it right, they refunded me enough to cover going to the store to purchase what should have been included in a new tower to complete my build, so props to Newegg.
I wouldn't be surprised if Antec isn't around in a year or so. I wouldn't recommend this case,simply based on it arriving incomplete and with a broken fan controller cable. Since they don't have a way to contact them, I worked around it and decided to repair the cable, find the extra parts and keep the case.

Cons: Outside is a little substandard. The front panel/door is poor quality. I guess something had to be cut to hit this great price point.

The feet are not big enough to be able to sit it on carpet and get enough airflow for the PSU. Place a flat piece of plastic or something similar underneath it if it will be on carpet or your PSU might overheat.

I know it is a midsize case but an extra half inch in height would be nice. The space between the modo and PSU is nearly zero. It is not a problem for me since I don't need the suplimental PCI-E power, but on the EVGA z97 FTW board, that connector is at the bottom of the mobo and faces downward. If you are planning to run SLI, make sure the mobo connectors aren't like my mobo or you will be returning the mobo or case.

The real manual is missing and only available online although all the cabling is pretty well marked and self-explanitory.

Cons: Airflow is questionable.
Room for cable management are little too tight for my liking.
I wish the front panel cables to the mobo is longer.
Overall Review: For the same price you could get NZXT H510. 4 included fan can be connected to the MOBO or through the MOLEX adapter included.

Using Molex will make the fan runs full speed all the time which can be noisy. I connected the fans to my mobo for the variable speed control.

A lot of comments said that the fans are noisy but in my case it was dead silent. PC temps are good so far. I suggest using the exhaust config to create negative airflow.

I like the nice clean look it has, though a bit bigger than I thought it would be, but that's a non-issue. The four included fans are nice as well, doing quite a bit for cooling.
Cons: A couple of the fan cables are a little short. One while still working was connected to the radiator fan connector, while another only barely reached the nearest fan connector.
It's front IO is nice, though the USB slots seem to be rather tight.
The included case fans do make a fair bit of noise, though it's not disruptively loud.

It's got a nice simplistic exterior design that isn't ugly, the power button has a nice soft white light to it, and the front USB and audio ports are positioned really nicely.
The interior is pretty neatly designed. I especially like the covert 2.5"" hard drive slots which I didn't even realize it had until I also realized I needed one and actively searched the frame for them. My hard drive is now a silent ninja supporting my computer from the shadows of it's hidden perch on the back wall of the frame.
The rubber feet are super sturdy and it's surprisingly light to carry.
The fans are really, really quiet!
Cons: The metal you have to remove for expansion bay slots, like your graphics card, is 1. not immediately apparent that it can be removed, 2. a little difficult to remove, and 3. a tad nerve wracking when removing... I was worried I would irreparably break something or cut myself. I did not, but it was a negative moment for the experience of the tower and computer assembly.
Overall Review: Basically, my computer is now a panther... you don't see it or hear it until it pounces on a graphics heavy task... roar.
I enjoy this immensely.

I am pleased with this tower and would recommend it to anyone with the following, or similar, space sensitive components, which fit inside this tower case perfectly:

Build quality is excellent and it satisfies my goal of having a nearly silent PC without lights flashing everywhere.

Cons: No room for push/pull radiator config due to GPU for bottom rad mount, or only installing two fans on bottom of case for side rad mount, no way to mount rad on top, only room for one HDD if 360mm rad mounted to side, basically not a case suited for some with more than on HDD setup unless using short radiator.
Overall Review: I like it. I use Nvme drives but also have one HDD in my setup for storage. I use a Corsair H150i for CPU cooling so it was a challenge to figure out how to mount rad on side. I like a push/pull setup for my rads and I could not do that so I sacrificed CPU cooling performance on my 9900k to be able to install my HDD. Otherwise I would have to install my rad on bottom of case which is not ideal(watch Gamers Nexus vid on bottom mounted rad if you don't believe me) but even then I could not do a push/pull because I mounted my GPU vertically(plenty of room if GPU mounted horizontally). The space behind my EVGA 850w G3 PSU was enough for excess cable storage and also has a cutout to drop CPU/GPU/RGB cables through. Removing feet to install bottom fans was not an issue like most reviews claim. GPU support arm was too short to use with my 1080ti so I removed it. Overall is a good case similar to the Lian-Li 011 Dynamic but only 4-star because I had to sacrifice my ideal setup to make this work. I wanted the Lian-Li but it was not available, even though I waited it out for 2 months for availability. I was too anxious to build this PC so I broke down and purchased this P120. I am not too terribly disappointed.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

I love the appearance with the glass and the build being unique in how the PSU is located above the motherboard. The glass door is so easy to open and close, and when building just slides off to be moved completely out of the way. The light up USB ports are definitely an interesting touch and I like the option of using the vertical GPU mount which I didn’t use because of the way this could impact heat, but I feel that since you could mount three 140 mm fans directly under the board and GPU, that this may not be an issue at all.
Cons: Only two things, I do wish it came with fans, even paying a little bit more for a set of three 140 mm fans would be a great option but still this sort of opens up your options to have a blank slate and not have to ditch fans you may not want to use. The second thing, is once I finished my build, the computer would turn off a few seconds after powering on. At first I thought I messed something up and a part was broken but after realizing that the power button was actually sticking if you push hard enough on one side, I contacted Antec and they responded within 50 minutes. There solution was really simple, which was to unscrew the front port board, remove it and put it back, which did fix it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,0

The case cables come securely and neatly stowed in the back.
Can hide P.S. cables underneath shroud if you want, thus no one can judge you and your laziness. :)
Cons: ""2.5 SSD unit"" drive bay in the back mounts the SSD's close to the motherboard. Could probably have shortened the thickness on the cage and have the drives mounted from the outside instead of in, thus trapping any heat.

My previous case wan an Antec and the difference is night and day (I think the old one was a Sonata). This case is nice!

- Bottom mounted power supply. Filtered air intake on bottom. Makes more sense than pulling hot air from inside case.
- Foam padding on top/front/sides for noise reduction.
- First case I've had with cable management (you run cables behind MB mounting plane - through soft grommets in place)
- 7 drive bays that mound drives with cables facing cable management area - once mounted in the drive holder, the drives snap into place.
- nice location for front USB connectors
Cons: - internal grommets become dislocated when pushing cables through, they're just a bit too soft
- Am I missing something? The expansion card slot covers have holes in them. This defeats the purpose of the air filter in the front since dirty air will be pulled through these holes. Easy to fix with duct tape. But was this done on purpose? Is it too difficult to get enough air through the front?
- You'll need to have this on a hard surface. If you place it on carpet, you're going to block the power supply air intake.

-Nice grommets for the wire and sufficient cable routing
-The 2 provided fans are relatively quiet and move air well
-Provided filters work very well. I have only had the computer for around 3 weeks and there is enough dust built up on the front filters to require cleaning.
-The door seems fairly sturdy
Cons: -Front fan mounting is pretty bad. Instead of 4 holes for fasteners they decided to put 2 small bumps and 2 holes. I get that the idea is to make location easier, but the 140mm fans I got (140mm Computer Case Cooling Fan Hydro Dynamic Bearing Silent 2 Speeds Rosewill) don't properly contact the bumps, causing the fasteners to twist the fan back into the case. In addition, the holes were too small for the rubber isolators typically sent with a fan.
-The front audio ports to the computer have a poor electrical connection. Mine kept shorting out which was making it detect something in the front ports, causing obnoxious pop-ups and sound interruptions to the point that I just disabled them. I wiggled the wires to track the issue and it was right at the mounting point. However, it wasn't a super big deal breaker and I was hardly going to take my entire computer apart for that.

Cons: The front audio and mic ports both fell off the enclosure into the space above the drive bays. I can't snap them back into place and are now unusable unless I pull them out the side of the case. The right-most usb 2.0 doesn't transfer data, only power over the usb. the rest still work

There's nothing flashy about the outside of this case. I love the clean minimalist design.
Cons: Doing the build is a serious PITA. Most everything about getting the computer built is counter intuitive. You need to remove both side panes to get started. The power supply has to mounted in a tunnel that requires all the power cables to be fed through a rectangular cut out in the tunnel to connect them. With a PSU with standard cabling. It's a lot of cables to fit through the hole. This case is a really good argument for buying a modular PSU.
I installed an M.2.280 Crucial PCI-E SSD, so I only had to connect power cables to the mainboard and a power cable and a data cable to the DVD drive.
The case includes good documentation, but if you don't know that it's all inside a cardboard box in a drive cage in the bottom of the case, it isn't very useful.
This was a trying build, and I've built something like 400 computers in my business.
When you get it put together, it's a pretty nice package. I built this machine for my older daughter, her husband, and my soon arriving granddaughter in Germany.
The documentation really needs to be better, because with out it, doing the build is much harder than it should be.

Sound deadener helps with the noise a little bit, but don't expect a miracle.

Build includes
- ASRock X570 xtreme4 wifi-ax
- Ryzen 7 3800x
- Kingston Predator 8gbx4 2666mhz DDR4
- EKWB 360mm AIO (new release from them at time of review)
- RTX 2070 super
- Seagate firecuda NVMe Gen4 SSD
- EVGA Nu audio pro 7.1 sound card
- EVGA 1300 watt G2 power supply (overkill, I know)

Gaming performance is still excellent, although I would look for a case with better airflow for Ryzen 9 and RTX 2080 systems, as my system, I would describe the cooling performance as, ""just getting by"", like, you know how when you open the oven while baking brownies, and you feel all that hot air rise up and out of it? That's how this is when you take the side panel off, just a glorious ploom of hot air that feels amazing as it rises past your face. Still definitely couldn't make brownies in it though.
Cons: The 5.25 DVD holder was partly detached inside the case, and the holes weren't properly threaded, which caused the thumb screw to strip out. Furthermore, I later discovered when I actually started my new build that the motherboard tray was bent. Finally, the power supply mounting system wasn't exactly a precision line up, and required a little persuasion to get everything lined up and installed.
Overall Review: More on the cons later, I want to get into the good about this case before I start shredding it.

This case overall was pleasing to build in once I got past all the obstacles, and overall, I would highly recommend this case to anyone who isn't a fan of all the bells and whistles and tempered glass nonsense that's included in today's cases, on top of wanting a quickly vanishing 5.25 inch drive, which I'm a firm believer in. The sound proofing is a bit of a plus, and seems to be helping a little, but don't expect complete silence if you're running a 360mm liquid cooler. It certainly does help with a graphics card noise though. The silence of this case does come at a cost of higher operating temps though, the single rear 140mm isn't working miracles. What I mean by that is that any 140 would struggle in a restrictive case such as this, as there's almost no intake ventilation points. I would recommend fans built for high static pressure.

Cable management is amazing for what it is, there are tie down points a plenty, but careful planning is still needed. There is a designated main channel you can run your 24 pin and a few extras through, but there isn't much room for crossovers unless you're planning to leave the cover off, and I actually wound up routing my PCIe power and one sata lead through the PSU basement floor, rather than the cutouts in the motherboard tray. The sata lead was for the sound card.

Now for the ugly

Had to run to the hardware store and buy sufficient hardware to fix the DVD driver holder, which required minor drilling to make the holes larger. I can forgive this, as they can't get 100% of these things correct when they're manufacturing thousands of cases of different types and sizes, I'm sure the guy who did this thought he got it in, but didn't, which led to that. What I can't forgive is that the motherboard tray was bent, which is only really cause by gross negligence, and required a little bit of trial and error bending it back until all 9 of the mounts lined up. It was a steel plate equivalent of a rubix cube, you would get one corrected, but threw off the other and so fourth.

There are other shortcomings too. If you planned for liquid cooling, especially 360mm cooling, not all coolers will fit with a DVD drive installed, in fact, I think the DVD holder is supposed to be removed for 360's, but mine fit. My 360mm radiator resting on the floor of the case, and I have 2mm between the DVD drive holder, and the radiator, so if you plan to have a DVD drive and 360mm cooling, keep that in mind. The total length of my radiator is 394mm. Furthermore, to make water cooling work WITH the 3.5 bays installed, the radiator mounts from the inside, and you install the fans on the outside, sandwiching the fan mount rails between the fans and radiator, which isn't too much of a problem, but the rails aren't continuous, there are small gaps which appear to be break-away gaps, and am unsure why one would want to break away the fan rails, but the top most screw holes in my radiator line up with one of these gaps, and not the actual screw holes, and trying to get a screw through this gap would strip it. I tried drilling, but the drill bit immediately pulled the rails way out, so I abandoned that, and just decided to leave out those screws, but I may revisit that in the future.

Definitely not a fan of PSU basements, and if there is one single complaint I could make about this case, is that, not the defects, or the small oversights, it's that. The PSU basement limits your cable routing options, and requires long power leads to reach everything. Thankfully mine were long enough, but that may not be the case for everyone. On top of that, there's plenty of ventilation in the bottom that could go into the case, but is blocked off by the basement, so it hinders cooling performance as well. The only real benefit is keeping the rats nest hidden, but I'm more a function over form type person.

At the end of it all, while I would still be inclined to purchase this chassis, I would be less afraid to keep my options open. My decision factor on this chassis is the lack of flashy nonsense while still looking sleek and capable rather than bland.",0.0,2.0,4.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I've built many computers over the years, and this is the first one in the last five. This is the first case that I've built in, that hasn't made me shout, curse, or scream in anger! I didn't cut/scrape my hands once!!

First off, unpacking the case was very easy. The case is protected by foam, a cloth bag, and all the windows are covered in plastic. All the standoffs were already set up properly for my Asus TUF GAMING X570-PLUS motherboard. It was easy to remove both side panels to lay the computer down and install everything directly inside of the case.

I had to put the side-window against a wall, so I can't see from that side, so I'm glad that there is also a front window that I can use to peek into my system!

All the buttons, USB, and audio output, are on the top of the case. I put my computer on the floor, so this makes it really easy for me to use these features without bending down. All the connections are covered with rubber plugs to keep out the dust.

Cons: Antec quality control is clearly to blame for the damaged unit. As with so many other reviews of their products in recent years, the outer box showed no sign of damaged. The unit inside, though, is badly bent on one rear lower corner, preventing proper mounting of the bottom air filter and preventing installation of a power supply.
Overall Review: Frankly, I don't care that one of the two arrived in one piece. One didn't, and that sets the tone for the entire experience. I have to go through the hassle of dealing with an RMA, and I have very little confidence that the replacement will be intact. Given the number of complaints about damaged units with intact outer boxes one sees in the reviews for various Antec chassis, it seems this is a common issue.

I've used Antec chassis and power supplies for years (I've built more machines than I can count, both at work and home). I can echo the sentiments found in a lot of other reviews: their quality control has gone to the dogs.

Overall Review: I never buy expensive cases which to me means anything over a hundred bucks. This case is so great I would have paid upwards of two hundred bucks and felt great doing it. This case is amazing for all of my needs, it even actually fit the 360 mm Radiator that i put in without leaving any gaps when i adjusted it slightly. I will be buying another one of these for my wife's computer simply because it is by far the best case i have ever bought and is exactly the kind of thing i would gladly build in again.",0.0,0.0,2.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Fans are okay quality and there are 4 non-pwm 140mm fans included.
Cons: Mounting hardware was abysmal.

They included a mounting tray for 2.5'' drives that is a combination grommet/screw that is suppose to make the mounting and maintenance of the drives super easy. Unfortunately, the screws that came with my case have a very coarse threading, instead of the fine machine screw thread that most SSD's require for mounting, so before I realized it, the screws had destroyed the mounting holes in my very expensive SSD. Not sure if this was an intentional oversight to save money - or what - but it certainly cost me much more than this case did.
Overall Review: Great concept for a case. Horrible execution.
The motherboard drops into a recessed plate that makes cabling easy, until you realize there are only 2 side holes to run all of your cabling through.

There's only room for 1 x 3.5'' hard drive, so keep that in mind if your storage needs are great.
The price is right if you don't have the need for extra hard drive installations.",1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,8.0,1,1,1

Cons: -no obvious way to mount an intake fan in the bottom of the case after HDD storage trays are removed. This is not a deal breaker, but I would like to take advantage of the filter for more than just my PSU intake.
-rubber grommets on the pass thrus would be a nice addition, but metal is round and not sharp, so this is a decent compromise

Cons: The main issue with these (i got a bundle of 3) is the fact that a write error happens after a minute of use until I fully reformat the drive (not quick format, slow format)
Also while the plastic is nice looking, I already see grooves appearing on the plastic connectors, so I don't think it will last that long...
Overall Review: Would I recommend this? If you are ok with having a 1/3 failure rate of your drive, sure. But otherwise I'd avoid this.",0.0,6.0,7.0,3.0,34.0,1,1,1

Cons: Very flimsy and cheap construction. The area around the connector which is normally metal is part of the rest of the device housing and made from very thin plastic. I also have connection troubles like others with this device. Sometimes it will work sometimes it doesn't. Takes more often then not multiple attempts to show up in the boot menu or being recognized at all in Windows under removable devices.
Overall Review: I really like Team Group, have multiple SSDs and Memory from that company and good experience with their customer service, but this device fails in every aspect.

Price - the biggest Pros. I know usb 2.0 is old and slow, but perfect for some windows installation software since it is working with almost any old computer, will try to use it for resetting passwords and installing drivers on my newest windows installation, in a PCs with UEFI and nonUEFI BIOS.
Cons: I wish it would be smaller, but at the same time, I don't want it to be too small and easy to loose.
Overall Review: I saved all my music and some of audio books on that stick - work perfect with my Mazda 3 stock radio, plays everything nicely. I was curious at first, since I did not know if it gonna work, old radios have a 8Gb limit on flash drives they might work. But this drive works with all 32 Gb.

Overall Review: We'll see how the rma goes on the one stick.

Cons: Cannot run at advertised speed on an MSI Z390 board with 9900K
Overall Review: I’ve used G. Skill RAM for my past three builds, as well as computers I assembled for friends. While the RAM isn’t causing BSOD or freezing, it does create an unbearable stutter in every game I play. Increasing the voltage to 1.39V helps, but it still stutters about once per minute. Whether using XMP or manually setting the clock rate to 3600, the result is the same. Allowing it to downclock to the stock mobo speed seems to be the only thing that fixes the issue.
It’s incredibly disappointing and frustrating to upgrade to a worse gaming experience. I will look elsewhere for my future RAM needs.",1.0,2.0,2.0,14.0,46.0,1,1,1

Due to (a) the system board's lower power management ability (see online reviews) and (b) the Zen+ Ryzen cpu's lower ram speed threshold (when compared to a Zen 2 such as a Ryzen 5 3600);

I was able to, using the Ryzen Dram calculator, run 1 set (2 sticks) of this memory at 3200 Mhz with 1.35 volts at tCL 14, (tRCD)WR/RD 15/17, tRP 18, tRAS 30, & tRC 44. (Various other subtimings changed as well.) It could run with even tighter manual timings, based on the calculator, but I chose to stick with this middle ground between ""SAFE"" & ""FAST"". No stability issues.

Based on the above, I bought another set of the ram, for 64 GBs total, and am successfully running the ram (at the same timings) at a reduced speed of 2933 Mhz. (The system wasn't stable at 3200 Mhz.) Continued subtiming tweaks will be applied and tested in the coming weeks.

I do not fault the ram for the speed limitation, as the system board & Zen+ memory controller are the likely culprits.

The ram is highly likely to meet its stated speed and timings on an AMD Zen 2 cpu using manual timing, speed, and power input. (Never trust XMP to do the best job, especially on an AMD platform.)
Cons: None as of this review.
Overall Review: For this system build, after suffering a disappointment with a competitor's memory, I purchased this 3600 Mhz kit, paired with the 570 chipset platform, to (in two years or so) upgrade to a Zen 2+/Zen 3 Ryzen 5 4600 (or similar).

As such, with the likely increased official memory support speed increase from 3200 Mhz to 3600 Mhz (or similar), this purchase (a) has fixed the issue I had with the competitor's memory, (b) allowed the upgrade to 64 GB (maxing out the system for its life), and (c) will allow me to upgrade the cpu in the future, change the speed and timings, and already have my system setup for several more years of life.

Not anything I care about but it's the only ""drawback"" anyone looking at this kit might see if they are comparing it to the MUCH higher price of any other kit with matching specs.
Overall Review: Running these guys at 3733 @ XMP timings no problem. Ryzen 3600 on MSI B450 Tomahawk. I'm giving them 1.375v but I'm not sure they even need the voltage bump to do it. Been busy enjoying them after initially verifying stability at this speed which is essentially the sweet spot for Ryzen performance. Memtest using test 5 and 8 - 10 passes stable and loving it. I will eventually try bringing the secondary timings to 16 from 19 but for now I'm really digging the performance for the price.

Why waste money on b-die?
32gb capacity in a near b-die specced kit @ this price WOWSA this kit somehow gets you everything for less money by far

RYZEN 3000 USERS HAVING TROUBLE WITH XMP - NOT ALL BOARDS WILL CORRECTLY AUTO ADJUST VOLTAGE WITH XMP SO MANUALLY SET vDIMM/MEMORY VOLTAGE TO 1.35v-1.4v WHEN YOU ENABLE XMP (before saving and rebooting)

RYZEN 2000 and 1000 series users!! YOUR CPU CANNOT SUPPORT MEMORY SPEED OF 3600mhz! This is not this or any other kit's fault, nor your motherboard's, but is a limitation of the cpu's OMC -> those older cpus have less capable onboard memory controllers preventing them from getting memory frequency much above 3000-3200mhz.

This is still a great kit for you to get that you can run at higher speeds when you upgrade to Ryzen 3000. Almost all boards will allow you to set XMP and then manually set your memory frequency to what will be stable with Ryzen 1000/2000 cpus (3000mhz is pretty reliably stable on those cpus without tinkering) This way you do not have to mess with timings just to achieve stability. You can of course achieve even tighter timings and slightly higher speeds (3200mhz+) if you are an experienced overclocker.

TLDR-
TO REACH 3600mhz @ XMP SETTINGS YOU NEED TO BE RUNNING RYZEN 3000 SERIES CPU OR RECENT GEN INTEL. IF RYZEN 2000/1000 SERIES - YOUR CPU LIMITS YOUR MEMORY SPEED - SET XMP TO ENABLE, VDIMM VOLTAGE TO 1.3v AND LOWER FREQ TO 3000MHZ AND ENJOY TILL YOU UPGRADE CPU",0.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,46.0,1,1,1

Cons: Doesn't run at its 3600 MHz XMP profile in any ASUS X570 chipset motherboard, even though its on the ASUS QVL for those boards.
Overall Review: I had a not so good experience with the 2x8GB kits of 3600 MHz C16 DDR4 RAM from G.Skill. I thought maybe this RAM would be better quality and decided to take a chance because it was on sale. It was a bad decision.

I tried this RAM in the ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus (Wi-Fi) X570 board and couldn't even get the system to boot with the RAM running at the XMP profile with a 3950X CPU. This RAM is on the ASUS QVL for this motherboard. Then I tried it in the ASUS ROG Strix X570-E Gaming motherboard and a 3800X CPU. I had the exact same issue. The CPs would boot at RAM speeds below 3600 MHz. However it would not boot at the XMP 3600 MHz profile. I had a similar issue with the 2x8GB 3600 MHz C16 kits.

At this point I wouldn't recommend this RAM for any x570 motherboards. I'm sure someone from G.Skill will write some sort of reply defending their product and talking to me like I'm a child who never built a PC before. I've been building PC's since the 1990's and build at least a dozen custom PCs a year for other people. I know what I'm doing and this RAM just doesn't work right. Four different kits in 7 different motherboards and all of them have the same issue.

At this point I have given up on G.SKill RAM. Corsair DDR4 3600 MHz RAM works in all the systems without any issue. The G.Skill doesn't. All systems have the latest BIOS. I've tried everything I could with troubleshooting. Nothing works. I really doubt by random chance had 4 bad kits sent to me.",0.0,3.0,4.0,14.0,46.0,1,1,1

picked up by mobo no probs (except at 2133)
no BSOD or errors until...
Cons: none so far
Overall Review: So far, I am happy. I put this on an Asus x570 Tuf gaming board with Ryzen 7 3700. I had no problems getting the RAM up and working. However, for those looking at this MOBO, be aware it runs the RAM at 2133Mhz instead of 3600. When I tried to change the RAM settings in the BIOS, I was unable to boot. I had to remove the battery for a minute and then run at 2133. I haven't tried again since, but I will.

That is not a knock on G.Skill. I have always heard good things about them and the Ripjaws series. It was enough to convince me to swap from the usual brand I buy.

The ram gets to xmp and doesn't cause any issues during benchmarks and stress tests. The only con is the height of the heatsinks.

Memory is rated for 1.35V and 3600 vs my previous 1.2V at 2400
Easy physical install.
Only been running it for a week or 2 now, so far so good.
Cons: Though the memory has been tested to 3600 you might find as I did that I can only clock it to 3200 due to the age of my motherboard (LGA1151, i5 6600K). This is no fault of the memory provider. Had I done more research, I likely would’ve saved money on some 3200 speed memory. I’m not mad just a warning to others to check the max memory speed supported by your MB and buy accordingly. Due to not Initially knowing The limits of my MB, the UEFI setup took longer than it should. I was unable to run the XMP profile as I had to de-clock to 3200.
Overall Review: The memory runs great once configured properly. Major settings were 1.35V and 3200 clock speed in my case. If your PC doesn’t boot properly, play with the voltage and clocking until it works. Without any settings change my UEFI defaulted to 1.2V and 2200.

That's not really a fault, but beware if you're expecting the timing flexibility that 16GB kits tend to have on 3xxx Ryzen...

If you *really* must have 16-16-16-16 timings, you probably should pay for the next kit up.

Cons: - Does not actually hit the rated speed with stability. At 1.35v, my system experienced random application crashes for a few minutes, then a BSOD (0x1000007e (0xffffffffc0000005, 0xfffff8077052bab0, 0xffffa10ad46de0c8, 0xffffa10ad46dd910).
This suggest that the memory is being sold at the very bleeding edge of its capability, is minimally overclockable, and is a bit of a gamble as to whether it works as listed.
To be fair, this memory is not QVL for this board, but I have never had an issue with that in the past, especially with Asus ROG boards.

Don't get your hopes up for overclocking these, and be happy if they run to spec.
Thaiphoon shows zero entries of these chips running at or past their stated speed.

Then I decided I had nothing to lose and put it on the highest clock profile, 3600mhz and that completely fried them. It would even boot into the bios, and after trying about 5 times more, the screen started flickering and turning off randomly. Finally, they just burnt out completely I guess, and the burnt solder smell got even stronger. Worst experience ever, very disappointing GSKILL, and a very big waste of time. I've seen multiple reviews saying that their's wouldn't run at the rated mhz, exactly 3200, just like me. (and the issues with flickering and turning off.)

Overall Review: I’ve used G. Skill RAM for my past three builds, as well as computers I assembled for friends. While the RAM isn’t causing BSOD or freezing, it does create an unbearable stutter in every game I play. Increasing the voltage to 1.39V helps, but it still stutters about once per minute. Whether using XMP or manually setting the clock rate to 3600, the result is the same. Allowing it to downclock to the stock mobo speed seems to be the only thing that fixes the issue.

Due to (a) the system board's lower power management ability (see online reviews) and (b) the Zen+ Ryzen cpu's lower ram speed threshold (when compared to a Zen 2 such as a Ryzen 5 3600);

I was able to, using the Ryzen Dram calculator, run 1 set (2 sticks) of this memory at 3200 Mhz with 1.35 volts at tCL 14, (tRCD)WR/RD 15/17, tRP 18, tRAS 30, & tRC 44. (Various other subtimings changed as well.) It could run with even tighter manual timings, based on the calculator, but I chose to stick with this middle ground between ""SAFE"" & ""FAST"". No stability issues.

Based on the above, I bought another set of the ram, for 64 GBs total, and am successfully running the ram (at the same timings) at a reduced speed of 2933 Mhz. (The system wasn't stable at 3200 Mhz.) Continued subtiming tweaks will be applied and tested in the coming weeks.

I do not fault the ram for the speed limitation, as the system board & Zen+ memory controller are the likely culprits.

The ram is highly likely to meet its stated speed and timings on an AMD Zen 2 cpu using manual timing, speed, and power input. (Never trust XMP to do the best job, especially on an AMD platform.)
Cons: None as of this review.
Overall Review: For this system build, after suffering a disappointment with a competitor's memory, I purchased this 3600 Mhz kit, paired with the 570 chipset platform, to (in two years or so) upgrade to a Zen 2+/Zen 3 Ryzen 5 4600 (or similar).

As such, with the likely increased official memory support speed increase from 3200 Mhz to 3600 Mhz (or similar), this purchase (a) has fixed the issue I had with the competitor's memory, (b) allowed the upgrade to 64 GB (maxing out the system for its life), and (c) will allow me to upgrade the cpu in the future, change the speed and timings, and already have my system setup for several more years of life.

Not anything I care about but it's the only ""drawback"" anyone looking at this kit might see if they are comparing it to the MUCH higher price of any other kit with matching specs.
Overall Review: Running these guys at 3733 @ XMP timings no problem. Ryzen 3600 on MSI B450 Tomahawk. I'm giving them 1.375v but I'm not sure they even need the voltage bump to do it. Been busy enjoying them after initially verifying stability at this speed which is essentially the sweet spot for Ryzen performance. Memtest using test 5 and 8 - 10 passes stable and loving it. I will eventually try bringing the secondary timings to 16 from 19 but for now I'm really digging the performance for the price.

Why waste money on b-die?
32gb capacity in a near b-die specced kit @ this price WOWSA this kit somehow gets you everything for less money by far

RYZEN 3000 USERS HAVING TROUBLE WITH XMP - NOT ALL BOARDS WILL CORRECTLY AUTO ADJUST VOLTAGE WITH XMP SO MANUALLY SET vDIMM/MEMORY VOLTAGE TO 1.35v-1.4v WHEN YOU ENABLE XMP (before saving and rebooting)

RYZEN 2000 and 1000 series users!! YOUR CPU CANNOT SUPPORT MEMORY SPEED OF 3600mhz! This is not this or any other kit's fault, nor your motherboard's, but is a limitation of the cpu's OMC -> those older cpus have less capable onboard memory controllers preventing them from getting memory frequency much above 3000-3200mhz.

This is still a great kit for you to get that you can run at higher speeds when you upgrade to Ryzen 3000. Almost all boards will allow you to set XMP and then manually set your memory frequency to what will be stable with Ryzen 1000/2000 cpus (3000mhz is pretty reliably stable on those cpus without tinkering) This way you do not have to mess with timings just to achieve stability. You can of course achieve even tighter timings and slightly higher speeds (3200mhz+) if you are an experienced overclocker.

TLDR-
TO REACH 3600mhz @ XMP SETTINGS YOU NEED TO BE RUNNING RYZEN 3000 SERIES CPU OR RECENT GEN INTEL. IF RYZEN 2000/1000 SERIES - YOUR CPU LIMITS YOUR MEMORY SPEED - SET XMP TO ENABLE, VDIMM VOLTAGE TO 1.3v AND LOWER FREQ TO 3000MHZ AND ENJOY TILL YOU UPGRADE CPU",0.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,46.0,1,1,1

Running a Ryzen 3950X in an ASUS X570-P the RAM auto-defaults to slowest DDR4 speed.
Cons: Using D.O.C.P ram detects higher speed and appears to work steady but memory hungry games will eventually manifest the issue of randomly dropping the user back to the desktop. Memory tests have been run for hours. No error messages are generated when playing games. Problem occurs after 10-40 minutes of game play. randomly. CPU and GPU temps are normal.

Cons: Despite being on the Asus QVL list and being able to boot at 3600, this ram crashes in every game I tried and just sends you to the desktop with no error. I ran memtest overnight with no issues, its just in games and some programs like Solidworks that it crashes. I swapped in a different set of 3600 ram also on the Asus QVL list and it worked just fine. So Asus needs to take this off their list because even after emailing them and using setting given to me by them, it still wouldnt work. Avoid if you have the Prime X570-P motherboard.

Cons: Doesn't run at its 3600 MHz XMP profile in any ASUS X570 chipset motherboard, even though its on the ASUS QVL for those boards.
Overall Review: I had a not so good experience with the 2x8GB kits of 3600 MHz C16 DDR4 RAM from G.Skill. I thought maybe this RAM would be better quality and decided to take a chance because it was on sale. It was a bad decision.

I tried this RAM in the ASUS TUF Gaming X570-Plus (Wi-Fi) X570 board and couldn't even get the system to boot with the RAM running at the XMP profile with a 3950X CPU. This RAM is on the ASUS QVL for this motherboard. Then I tried it in the ASUS ROG Strix X570-E Gaming motherboard and a 3800X CPU. I had the exact same issue. The CPs would boot at RAM speeds below 3600 MHz. However it would not boot at the XMP 3600 MHz profile. I had a similar issue with the 2x8GB 3600 MHz C16 kits.

At this point I wouldn't recommend this RAM for any x570 motherboards. I'm sure someone from G.Skill will write some sort of reply defending their product and talking to me like I'm a child who never built a PC before. I've been building PC's since the 1990's and build at least a dozen custom PCs a year for other people. I know what I'm doing and this RAM just doesn't work right. Four different kits in 7 different motherboards and all of them have the same issue.

At this point I have given up on G.SKill RAM. Corsair DDR4 3600 MHz RAM works in all the systems without any issue. The G.Skill doesn't. All systems have the latest BIOS. I've tried everything I could with troubleshooting. Nothing works. I really doubt by random chance had 4 bad kits sent to me.",0.0,3.0,4.0,14.0,46.0,1,1,1

Cons: none so far
Overall Review: So far, I am happy. I put this on an Asus x570 Tuf gaming board with Ryzen 7 3700. I had no problems getting the RAM up and working. However, for those looking at this MOBO, be aware it runs the RAM at 2133Mhz instead of 3600. When I tried to change the RAM settings in the BIOS, I was unable to boot. I had to remove the battery for a minute and then run at 2133. I haven't tried again since, but I will.

That is not a knock on G.Skill. I have always heard good things about them and the Ripjaws series. It was enough to convince me to swap from the usual brand I buy.

The ram gets to xmp and doesn't cause any issues during benchmarks and stress tests. The only con is the height of the heatsinks.

Memory is rated for 1.35V and 3600 vs my previous 1.2V at 2400
Easy physical install.
Only been running it for a week or 2 now, so far so good.
Cons: Though the memory has been tested to 3600 you might find as I did that I can only clock it to 3200 due to the age of my motherboard (LGA1151, i5 6600K). This is no fault of the memory provider. Had I done more research, I likely would’ve saved money on some 3200 speed memory. I’m not mad just a warning to others to check the max memory speed supported by your MB and buy accordingly. Due to not Initially knowing The limits of my MB, the UEFI setup took longer than it should. I was unable to run the XMP profile as I had to de-clock to 3200.
Overall Review: The memory runs great once configured properly. Major settings were 1.35V and 3200 clock speed in my case. If your PC doesn’t boot properly, play with the voltage and clocking until it works. Without any settings change my UEFI defaulted to 1.2V and 2200. Star Citizen has really sped up though a lot of that was due to a new m.2 SSD install at the same time. Overall happy with purchase.",0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,46.0,1,1,1

It's 32GB at CAS16 on a budget... well maybe ""less costly"" might be more accurate ;p
Cons: Could not tighten timings or increase speed at all.

That's not really a fault, but beware if you're expecting the timing flexibility that 16GB kits tend to have on 3xxx Ryzen...

If you *really* must have 16-16-16-16 timings, you probably should pay for the next kit up.
Overall Review: This is the first (and only so far) 32GB kit I've gotten to play with, so It could very well be my inexperience with these bigger kits but it was rather startling that these wouldn't budge *at all* timing or speed wise. We're talking No-POST failure - even if I loosened timings it just wasn't happening.

Again this isn't a complaint against this memory, it's more that if you're expecting to get a bit more speed out of these like you commonly can with 16GB kits... it doesn't seem to be as easy with 16gb sticks.",1.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,46.0,1,1,1

So far it handles everything I throw at it like a champ. The screen looks pretty good after you run Windows calibration. Battery lasts about 1-3 hours depending on what you are doing. Solid laptop and even though this model is out of stock, I'm sure the other ones that feature the 2060 or 2070 cards are just as solid.
Cons: The new 10th gen runs hot. I average 85-98c during gaming and about 60-75c doing no gaming tasks. I figure once support for the 10th gen chips is offered in Throttle Stop or Intel Tuning, we can get a nice 3.6-3.8ghz turbo clock under volt that will get those temps down 10-15c and retain most the power of the cpu.

Overall Review: I want to edit my response above, and I will if they make it right. I'm sending it back to get a replacement. I took a lot of time to install all of my favorite games. It took a long time (due to download speed, not the computer). I played all of them for a little time to make sure the settings were good. Everything ran perfectly and with very high graphics settings. Went to work, came back, opened the lid and the computer was stuck on an endless loop trying to reinstall Windows. I tried every option, leaving the more drastic options for last. Nothing worked.
I just got the computer. I should not be having troubles already. I'll give them one more chance since lemons are always a possibility in this industry (though sometimes lemons get through due to poor quality control).

It runs so buttery smooth and surprises me almost daily with how immersive it feels. it runs fairly cool for all the power it has. I love the MSI control panel, it allows me to set preset fan controls and monitor CPU/GPU temps. The keyboard colors and controls are extremely cool, I get board easily so this may be just what I need as I can change the feel at will.
Cons: *The fans are loud, my girlfriend asked me the other day when my plane was going to lift off. guess that's the trade off for the performance of this machine, a trade off I can live with.
*one other weird thing that is annoying is the mouse buttons are very loud and clunky hopefully that is because they are built to last.
Overall Review: great buy, could not believe the transit time. I ordered it at 5:11 pm my time and it was shipped from CA and delivered to me in NH the following after noon, and I didn't pay for overnight shipping. another cool thing was being able to track my order so easily I was able to watch the plane land that was carrying my new laptop...I know this has nothing to do with the product but it added to the buying experience.",1.0,3.0,3.0,26.0,23.0,1,1,1

No issues whatsoever. I would imagine it would run any game on the market today. Very fast, love that I can kick the cooling fan on if I want.

Very solid and well made.
Cons: My main issue is that my space bar works about 1/2 the time. I use my right thumb and it works maybe 50% of the time when I hit it. So, when I look up at my page it's a mess. After getting all my programs up and running, I am hesitant to send the laptop back. But I am not happy, and can't figure how to fix it or what is wrong.
Another is a Red Dragon app that runs in the task bar. Despite taking it out of the Startup and unchecking the run at startup in the Red Dragon app. It's back after every reboot. Looking online, it appears to be a coding issue, and I'm not ready to dig in yet.
Overall Review: Cons above. My biggest beef is not with the laptop, but Win10. The system fonts and taskbar a tiny. If you have vision issues, beware. I have looked everywhere for a fix. It seems MS doesn't care about this as they removed it from Win10. Win7 was easy to set and worked perfect.

And again, the space key is going to be a issue. Thisiswhatit looks like as I type a email or fill in a form.

4 stars due to the space bar issue and not being able to kill the Red Dragon app on reboot. Other than those, love it.

The graphics settings can be easily customized to what you are doing with just a few clicks. The NVMe SSD on the motherboard is a great addition and one of the main reasons I bought this, along with the GPU in it. The 2060 can run anything at high graphics with no hiccups at all. The amount of RAM pretty much makes adding any more a moot point as the 16GB is enough for pretty much anything you might do, except high intensity graphics design or the such. Very sturdy build, solid feel, and great performance especially for the price. Setup was easy, or as easy as Microsoft Windows lets it be. Make sure to do the survey on their site after registering because they add three additional months of warranty coverage.
Cons: Well, the NVMe is a bit disappointing. NVMe is supposedly significantly faster than a normal SATA SSD, but the one in this laptop is not showing it. granted I have had it less than a week, and am loving it, but the laptop it is replacing (6 years old, 4th Gen Core I7, RAM added to make it 24GB) has had it original HDD cloned and swapped out two years with a 500GB Samsung EVO SSD and boots in about 3 seconds to the Windows login screen. I am still looking to tweak it (but by admission ATM have not had the time or opportunity to delve into it more deeply), and looking at ways to lower the boot speed too, so I admit I have not made any real changes to it in that way. But the first time I fired it up l was actually tapping my fingers waiting. And still do every time I boot it. The case looks incredible, the MSI logo on the top is gorgeous, but, the case picks up every single fingerprint and apparently if you do not wash your hands with degreaser before touching it, it leave marks all over the lid and bezel. And yes I do wash my hands before using it as it is brand spanking new. I pretty much lift the screen with the tip of a finger on the corner to minimize how much I touch the plastic. Registering it on MSI's website took a while because the download they have to do it was not responding properly.
Overall Review: Very good laptop, excellent price vs other 'high end' makers. Good to excellent overall performance and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high end laptop for both gaming and everyday use. I just wish the NVMe performed better to compliment the CPU and RAM it has. All in all l really do love this laptop.",1.0,3.0,3.0,26.0,23.0,1,1,1

Opening it up to swap out the 2.5 inch HHD with a SSD was straight forward but required a credit card to unsnap the lower shell from the upper shell. Only took about 10 minutes total to complete.
The cooling is very good with all of the heat pipes and the two built in fans. I've ga,ed for hours without any thermal throttling.
Overall Review: I bought this to replace my old Dell N7110 (2nd gen i7, 8 GM ram, NVidia GT525M 1GM VRAM) so the improvement is 10 fold. In Fallout4 before I'd struggle to get a consistent 20-30 FPS, on low settings and 1280x720. Now I get a consistent 144 FPS on ultra settings in 1920x1080.
While not the Top of the line in gaming rigs available from MSI, it is a huge improvement over what I was gaming with and the price was very reasonable for what I got.

- dragon center software will not store battery health selection (allows you to undercharge the battery when not going mobile to help extend battery life) between boots, so I am left with always booting the computer off battery, reselecting a ""best for battery"" charging profile and then plugging the laptop back in... dumb
- MSI app player, a branded bluestacks to play android games. again great idea because these programs can be temperamental to get to work. but the version installed does not work. kinda defeats the purpose. the play store does not recognize any of your past purchases. it will try to make you purchase them a second time. you must go to the app store from a browser and push the purchase to the MSI app player to get around this glitch

I use this with my Oculus Quest and it works great via cable and decent on Virtual Desktop (but that's due to the wifi connection not the computer). Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great gaming computer.
Cons: These are more just like personal gripes about the aesthetics of the laptop.
- My previous laptop was a 17"" so the downgrade kind of sucked but I've definitely gotten used to it.
- My previous laptop also had a touchpad with the left and right click built in. I liked being able to press the touchpad in to click instead of moving my finger to the left and right click buttons. Again, I've gotten used to it, but I liked that feature in my old laptop.
- The keyboard has no tactile-ness to it. It feels kind of soft when you click in a key. Not what I was expecting, especially from Steelseries.
- I use this a lot in my bed and I needed to put an old binder underneath it because it gets really hot without constant airflow (which makes sense) but the fan is pretty loud even with proper airflow. Not a huge biggie though.

I haven't got it set up completely and haven't really tested it yet but what i have seen so far it is exceptionali got my entire picture library, my music mp3 library and my music video library on this thing with pretty much all apps and games that i have purchased from the microsoft store. Even all of my origin games. Steam games not so much but i got them installed on a 4tb mobile usb drive. Ray tracing in shadow of tomb raider and battlefield v is decent at hd 1920 x1080. The keyboard rgb is the coolest thing about this laptop. Ups took 7 days to deliever but it was worth the wait. I like how the video cards switch automatically when you are gaming and when it is on battery power. When it is using the onboard intel uhd graphics the power led turns white but when you are using the RTX 2060 the led light on power turns orange. I can recommend this latop cause the speed is fast and gaming is almost perfect with and without ray tracing enabled

Great for gaming
Features
Cons: None at this time
Overall Review: First off I have had this laptop 3-4 weeks. I am strictly a gamer so I am basing my opinions off that in particular. This is a model with the newer 115w RTX 2060 for those wondering. I mainly play single player games like AC:Odyssey, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Far Cry 5/ New Dawn and Horizon Zero Dawn. This laptop handles all those games at the highest settings looking great and running smooth on the 144Hz display.

I looked at many laptops and watched many reviews before making my purchase and for the money this seemed to have the most bang for my buck when it came to what I was looking for. It has a 512GB SSD so it boots up fast and it has an additional 1TB mechanical drive so plenty of storage to install all my games, most of the other laptops in the same price range only came with an SSD for the same price roughly.

- Audio out of the box is not optimal but once you make the necessary adjustments in the Realtek Audio Manager and Nahimic client, it has excellent sound and clarity.
- The same applies to the graphics on the system. By default, the out-of-the box configuration is set to auto switch between the integrated Intel Graphics and the RTX 2070 card. I have found that by setting it to manual and specifying which softwares/programs should be handled by the RTX2070 and not the integrated graphics, it runs faster, smoother and generates less heat; which helps to address the primary con that I have found.
- MSI's software allows for easy management, update of necessary software and system registration.
-Weight is excellent. Honestly not that heavy considering its size and performance.
-Screen is very clear, bright and easily viewed indoors and outside.

I've already looked in to a few additional upgrades for the system. Predominantly, upgrading the primary OS drive, adding/replacing the HDD with an SSD and increasing the RAM to at least 32GB. It doesn't need it to function exceptionally well for general purposes and gaming, even at high settings, but for what I do the extra system resources and responsiveness can provide a beneficial increase.
Cons: - Only downside that I can see is the fans are a bit loud when under a significant load. If you do not mind a bit of extra heat, you can set the fans to a lower speed to reduce sound. At the lower speed system will not overheat and I've seen no degradation in performance but it can become uncomfortable if you are holding it or if the laptop is sitting in your lap.
- I dislike that it comes standard with a mechanical disk drive but that is fine overall and good for system backups and data storage.
- The primary NVMe M.2 SSD is some generic brand with low-end read/write speeds, at least for an M.2 drive. It still surpasses most SATA SSDs. I don't think this is a significant issue. It definitely helps save on initial cost of the system. The same can be said of the RAM modules used out of the factory. Those components are easy to upgrade and cheaper to do after-market than direct from factory anyway due to mark-ups.

Overall Review: I've had this unit for about a month, and everything is as crisp and solid as the day I unboxed it and turned it on.

- fast
- powerful enough to run most new games at top settings
-nice design
- nice thin bezel screen
- nice keyboard
-strong refresh rate on screen
-good price
-feels solid build for being all plastic (minimal strain holding 1 handed)
- i like that theres an optional button for the fan say if it gets hotter than usual but rarely does, nice to have
-lots of memory space
-room for upgrades
-light compared to most laptops imo
-i like the mic and headset jack are seperate.
Cons: -battery is bad. had it for a month now, and it's already dying on me
-audio card is eh? pretty bad
-speakers are TERRIBLE (hi res sound > not the case) my old dell laptop had WAAAY better speakers. thats saying alot.....(and before you say anything, i've done a clean install of realtek hd audio and nahimic3 and it's still the same)
-microphone is SO BAD (picks up everything) my old dell, i could blast music and my friends could not hear it at all. but this time i'll have it at a minimal volume and they'll say it's loud. spent hours adjusting the boost, volume input, volume output and voice threshold. does nothing AT ALL. i mean ive tried in game settings, microsoft settings, sound settings, nahimic3 settings, nope microphone is just THAT BAD.
-nahimic3 SUCKS
-does not come with a built in equalizer? idk why newer tech stuff takes away programs that were not broken and free but now charge money to do something we've always have had the option to in the past.
- i wanted something to game as well have great sound but so far almost every msi ive tested in the past which r too many to count, they all have terrible audio but this one was marketed as double speakers hi res audio card bass boost giant speakers. ALL SMOKE. believe me im serious with my sound
-i have 1 thing good to say about the speakers, its clarity is decent.

It's faster than my desktop which was already great.
Gaming - High frame rates on ultra settings with antialiasing.
Screen - 1080p resolution is great, screen is bright, minimal backlight bleed. Matte screen is good
Case - it's overall fairly lightweight, backlit keyboard is fully customizable and awesome. Good action on the keys. You can switch the Fn / Windows keys if you prefer the win key on the left (I'm used to it there).
Cons: I haven't found an actual con yet!

It's a little loud, but not excessive imo, and I appreciate the airflow it creates when running high performance games. It also cools & quiets down quickly when a game is closed or even just alt-tabbed

There is a bit of bloatware (I'm looking at you lifelock/antivirus) and I had to edit a hidden file to keep some stuff from reappearing on the start bar, but these were no big deal and fairly common.

I guess the only other thing worth mentioning is if you want to upgrade anything on it (add another SSD or increase the RAM for example) you'll need to break the factory seal and essentially take the whole back apart, there's no small user access bay or anything.

I do wish it had more RAM for working with huge art files, but I'll just buy a RAM upgrade if it's needed down the road.

With a nice 10th gen i7 paired with an RTX 2070 this laptop runs everything on it. Playing Modern Warfare I keep the graphics for the most part on normal settings with certain settings being set to high and I'm averaging around 120 frames per second and even occasionally hitting the refresh rate of the screen itself which is amazing when I compare it to my desktop because it runs it almost as well. And temps are looking great! I had my doubts because the cpu idle temps without making any changes sat anywhere between 60-70 degrees which is a little concerning but it's a powerful processor crammed into this little machine. When playing Modern Warfare the cpu with fans kept on auto did not go above 80 but at the expense of the fans being very loud. I game with a gaming headset though so luckily I don't hear any of it especially when gaming. The GPU idles around 40 and while playing Modern Warfare did not exceed 75 degrees.
Cons: So the main drawback for me is power consumption. The power brick this laptop comes with is a 230w and you'd think it would be enough to keep the battery at 100% while gaming but sadly it does not. While playing Modern Warfare I noticed that my battery was depleting while gaming. It was very slow but it does go down. After about 25 minutes my battery went from 100% to 95% and if I kept playing it would continue to drop. Buy this knowing and expecting to probably have to buy a stronger power brick in the near future. I do not know yet if the laptop would shut off should the battery hit 0% but I doubt it would as the machine is plugged into the wall.
Overall Review: Overall for the specs this machine is absolutely worth it but it comes with an inefficient power brick considering it doesn't even keep the battery full while gaming so that's why it gets a 3 star. It would be 4 out of 5 but a gaming laptop/notebook should absolutely come with a power brick that's capable of keeping the battery sufficiently charged while under use with the parts that are inside the pc.",1.0,6.0,13.0,26.0,23.0,1,1,1

Cons: Not a normal 2070. Only pulls about 90 watts and only runs at 352 GB/s not your typical 448 GB/s like all other mobile 2070's (confirmed by GPU-Z). It chokes on most newer games at ultra settings so you'll have to lower settings to get anywhere near the 144 mark. It will only overclock to 408 GB/s before showing artifacts. I'd like to know what is going on with this card and how MSI/Newegg can sell it as a 2070 because it sure doesn't act like one.

Temps stay in check with the CPU in the low 80's and the GPU in the low 70's while gaming. Overclocking the GPU didn't change the temps at all.

1 Good Performance. : - But the credit goes to processor and RTX card, and not to MSI
2 Awesome keyboard:
3 Fans are bearable when not doing heavy work (Thanks) However, turbo mode is super loud. but it is very understandable.
Cons: 1. REAL BAD : The Battery Life. say Bye bye to battery life if you want to buy this laptop. Even when you are just typing on wordpad with all battery super saver on, 20% brightness, mute and low performance mode on. The Battery will die down in 1 and half hour. I wish there was a way to upgrade the battery from 51Whr to 84 Whr.
I mean 51whr for 17'' laptop? come on MSI. At least make sure the battery last for 4 hours for minor tasks like watching you tube videos. It doesn't.

2 Others small issues : -
Touchpad buttons : Are really bad. You have to press them hard and your thumb tips will start hurting if you have a habit of using buttons often.

The laptop external design and quality is Okay. The Entire body is made up of plastic (I really wish it was metal ). I think Laptop might fall apart in couple years. However it was not a tun off for me since I am a careful user.

3 Random suggestion/ ignore :-
On the keyboard the delete key is in the middle top of numpad keys. Which is usually at the corner of num pad or over the backspace button. This is bit inconvenient if you are a programmer or an editor, since it it one of the frequently used keys.
Overall Review: I wish there was a way to upgrade this battery to higher wattage say 84Whrs. I would be really satisfied. This is a high end laptop for me and for most other people. I wanted it to at least good in most areas such as performance, battery life, heat , Fan noise and build quality.

Cons: The new 10th gen runs hot. I average 85-98c during gaming and about 60-75c doing no gaming tasks. I figure once support for the 10th gen chips is offered in Throttle Stop or Intel Tuning, we can get a nice 3.6-3.8ghz turbo clock under volt that will get those temps down 10-15c and retain most the power of the cpu.

Everything ran perfectly and with very high graphics settings. Went to work, came back, opened the lid and the computer was stuck on an endless loop trying to reinstall Windows. I tried every option, leaving the more drastic options for last. Nothing worked.
I just got the computer. I should not be having troubles already. I'll give them one more chance since lemons are always a possibility in this industry (though sometimes lemons get through due to poor quality control).

If this is made right, I will edit my review. Everything else seems awesome... just one problem, it doesn't work. I think that's a pretty big issue. Lol.",1.0,3.0,3.0,32.0,36.0,1,1,1

Side note. Don't know if anyone else has this small issue. On the Number pad the 1,2,3,and 5 button seem really different to me and make a different noise when pressed. I cant explain the noise or feeling when pressing those buttons.

It runs so buttery smooth and surprises me almost daily with how immersive it feels. it runs fairly cool for all the power it has. I love the MSI control panel, it allows me to set preset fan controls and monitor CPU/GPU temps. The keyboard colors and controls are extremely cool, I get board easily so this may be just what I need as I can change the feel at will.
Cons: *The fans are loud, my girlfriend asked me the other day when my plane was going to lift off. guess that's the trade off for the performance of this machine, a trade off I can live with.
*one other weird thing that is annoying is the mouse buttons are very loud and clunky hopefully that is because they are built to last.
Overall Review: great buy, could not believe the transit time. I ordered it at 5:11 pm my time and it was shipped from CA and delivered to me in NH the following after noon, and I didn't pay for overnight shipping. another cool thing was being able to track my order so easily I was able to watch the plane land that was carrying my new laptop...I know this has nothing to do with the product but it added to the buying experience.",1.0,3.0,3.0,32.0,36.0,1,1,1

No issues whatsoever. I would imagine it would run any game on the market today. Very fast, love that I can kick the cooling fan on if I want.

Very solid and well made.
Cons: My main issue is that my space bar works about 1/2 the time. I use my right thumb and it works maybe 50% of the time when I hit it. So, when I look up at my page it's a mess. After getting all my programs up and running, I am hesitant to send the laptop back. But I am not happy, and can't figure how to fix it or what is wrong.
Another is a Red Dragon app that runs in the task bar. Despite taking it out of the Startup and unchecking the run at startup in the Red Dragon app. It's back after every reboot. Looking online, it appears to be a coding issue, and I'm not ready to dig in yet.
Overall Review: Cons above. My biggest beef is not with the laptop, but Win10. The system fonts and taskbar a tiny. If you have vision issues, beware. I have looked everywhere for a fix. It seems MS doesn't care about this as they removed it from Win10. Win7 was easy to set and worked perfect.

And again, the space key is going to be a issue. Thisiswhatit looks like as I type a email or fill in a form.

4 stars due to the space bar issue and not being able to kill the Red Dragon app on reboot. Other than those, love it.

The graphics settings can be easily customized to what you are doing with just a few clicks. The NVMe SSD on the motherboard is a great addition and one of the main reasons I bought this, along with the GPU in it. The 2060 can run anything at high graphics with no hiccups at all. The amount of RAM pretty much makes adding any more a moot point as the 16GB is enough for pretty much anything you might do, except high intensity graphics design or the such. Very sturdy build, solid feel, and great performance especially for the price. Setup was easy, or as easy as Microsoft Windows lets it be. Make sure to do the survey on their site after registering because they add three additional months of warranty coverage.
Cons: Well, the NVMe is a bit disappointing. NVMe is supposedly significantly faster than a normal SATA SSD, but the one in this laptop is not showing it. granted I have had it less than a week, and am loving it, but the laptop it is replacing (6 years old, 4th Gen Core I7, RAM added to make it 24GB) has had it original HDD cloned and swapped out two years with a 500GB Samsung EVO SSD and boots in about 3 seconds to the Windows login screen. I am still looking to tweak it (but by admission ATM have not had the time or opportunity to delve into it more deeply), and looking at ways to lower the boot speed too, so I admit I have not made any real changes to it in that way. But the first time I fired it up l was actually tapping my fingers waiting. And still do every time I boot it. The case looks incredible, the MSI logo on the top is gorgeous, but, the case picks up every single fingerprint and apparently if you do not wash your hands with degreaser before touching it, it leave marks all over the lid and bezel. And yes I do wash my hands before using it as it is brand spanking new. I pretty much lift the screen with the tip of a finger on the corner to minimize how much I touch the plastic. Registering it on MSI's website took a while because the download they have to do it was not responding properly.
Overall Review: Very good laptop, excellent price vs other 'high end' makers. Good to excellent overall performance and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high end laptop for both gaming and everyday use. I just wish the NVMe performed better to compliment the CPU and RAM it has. All in all l really do love this laptop.",1.0,3.0,3.0,32.0,36.0,1,1,1

Opening it up to swap out the 2.5 inch HHD with a SSD was straight forward but required a credit card to unsnap the lower shell from the upper shell. Only took about 10 minutes total to complete.
The cooling is very good with all of the heat pipes and the two built in fans. I've ga,ed for hours without any thermal throttling.
Overall Review: I bought this to replace my old Dell N7110 (2nd gen i7, 8 GM ram, NVidia GT525M 1GM VRAM) so the improvement is 10 fold. In Fallout4 before I'd struggle to get a consistent 20-30 FPS, on low settings and 1280x720. Now I get a consistent 144 FPS on ultra settings in 1920x1080.
While not the Top of the line in gaming rigs available from MSI, it is a huge improvement over what I was gaming with and the price was very reasonable for what I got.

- dragon center software will not store battery health selection (allows you to undercharge the battery when not going mobile to help extend battery life) between boots, so I am left with always booting the computer off battery, reselecting a ""best for battery"" charging profile and then plugging the laptop back in... dumb
- MSI app player, a branded bluestacks to play android games. again great idea because these programs can be temperamental to get to work. but the version installed does not work. kinda defeats the purpose. the play store does not recognize any of your past purchases. it will try to make you purchase them a second time. you must go to the app store from a browser and push the purchase to the MSI app player to get around this glitch

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great gaming computer.
Cons: These are more just like personal gripes about the aesthetics of the laptop.
- My previous laptop was a 17"" so the downgrade kind of sucked but I've definitely gotten used to it.
- My previous laptop also had a touchpad with the left and right click built in. I liked being able to press the touchpad in to click instead of moving my finger to the left and right click buttons. Again, I've gotten used to it, but I liked that feature in my old laptop.
- The keyboard has no tactile-ness to it. It feels kind of soft when you click in a key. Not what I was expecting, especially from Steelseries.
- I use this a lot in my bed and I needed to put an old binder underneath it because it gets really hot without constant airflow (which makes sense) but the fan is pretty loud even with proper airflow. Not a huge biggie though.

Even all of my origin games. Steam games not so much but i got them installed on a 4tb mobile usb drive. Ray tracing in shadow of tomb raider and battlefield v is decent at hd 1920 x1080. The keyboard rgb is the coolest thing about this laptop. Ups took 7 days to deliever but it was worth the wait.

Overall Review: First off I have had this laptop 3-4 weeks. I am strictly a gamer so I am basing my opinions off that in particular. This is a model with the newer 115w RTX 2060 for those wondering. I mainly play single player games like AC:Odyssey, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Far Cry 5/ New Dawn and Horizon Zero Dawn. This laptop handles all those games at the highest settings looking great and running smooth on the 144Hz display.

I looked at many laptops and watched many reviews before making my purchase and for the money this seemed to have the most bang for my buck when it came to what I was looking for. It has a 512GB SSD so it boots up fast and it has an additional 1TB mechanical drive so plenty of storage to install all my games, most of the other laptops in the same price range only came with an SSD for the same price roughly.

- Audio out of the box is not optimal but once you make the necessary adjustments in the Realtek Audio Manager and Nahimic client, it has excellent sound and clarity.
- The same applies to the graphics on the system. By default, the out-of-the box configuration is set to auto switch between the integrated Intel Graphics and the RTX 2070 card. I have found that by setting it to manual and specifying which softwares/programs should be handled by the RTX2070 and not the integrated graphics, it runs faster, smoother and generates less heat; which helps to address the primary con that I have found.
- MSI's software allows for easy management, update of necessary software and system registration.
-Weight is excellent. Honestly not that heavy considering its size and performance.
-Screen is very clear, bright and easily viewed indoors and outside.

I've already looked in to a few additional upgrades for the system. Predominantly, upgrading the primary OS drive, adding/replacing the HDD with an SSD and increasing the RAM to at least 32GB. It doesn't need it to function exceptionally well for general purposes and gaming, even at high settings, but for what I do the extra system resources and responsiveness can provide a beneficial increase.
Cons: - Only downside that I can see is the fans are a bit loud when under a significant load. If you do not mind a bit of extra heat, you can set the fans to a lower speed to reduce sound. At the lower speed system will not overheat and I've seen no degradation in performance but it can become uncomfortable if you are holding it or if the laptop is sitting in your lap.
- I dislike that it comes standard with a mechanical disk drive but that is fine overall and good for system backups and data storage.
- The primary NVMe M.2 SSD is some generic brand with low-end read/write speeds, at least for an M.2 drive. It still surpasses most SATA SSDs. I don't think this is a significant issue. It definitely helps save on initial cost of the system. The same can be said of the RAM modules used out of the factory. Those components are easy to upgrade and cheaper to do after-market than direct from factory anyway due to mark-ups.

-microphone is SO BAD (picks up everything) my old dell, i could blast music and my friends could not hear it at all. but this time i'll have it at a minimal volume and they'll say it's loud. spent hours adjusting the boost, volume input, volume output and voice threshold. does nothing AT ALL. i mean ive tried in game settings, microsoft settings, sound settings, nahimic3 settings, nope microphone is just THAT BAD.
-nahimic3 SUCKS
-does not come with a built in equalizer? idk why newer tech stuff takes away programs that were not broken and free but now charge money to do something we've always have had the option to in the past.
- i wanted something to game as well have great sound but so far almost every msi ive tested in the past which r too many to count, they all have terrible audio but this one was marketed as double speakers hi res audio card bass boost giant speakers. ALL SMOKE. believe me im serious with my sound
-i have 1 thing good to say about the speakers, its clarity is decent.

It's faster than my desktop which was already great.
Gaming - High frame rates on ultra settings with antialiasing.
Screen - 1080p resolution is great, screen is bright, minimal backlight bleed. Matte screen is good
Case - it's overall fairly lightweight, backlit keyboard is fully customizable and awesome. Good action on the keys. You can switch the Fn / Windows keys if you prefer the win key on the left (I'm used to it there).
Cons: I haven't found an actual con yet!

It's a little loud, but not excessive imo, and I appreciate the airflow it creates when running high performance games. It also cools & quiets down quickly when a game is closed or even just alt-tabbed

There is a bit of bloatware (I'm looking at you lifelock/antivirus) and I had to edit a hidden file to keep some stuff from reappearing on the start bar, but these were no big deal and fairly common.

I guess the only other thing worth mentioning is if you want to upgrade anything on it (add another SSD or increase the RAM for example) you'll need to break the factory seal and essentially take the whole back apart, there's no small user access bay or anything.

I do wish it had more RAM for working with huge art files, but I'll just buy a RAM upgrade if it's needed down the road.

Overall Review: I've had this PC for about a week now and its exactly what I thought it would be. Was looking to replace my PC which had an 460GTX in it so I could start gaming again.

With a nice 10th gen i7 paired with an RTX 2070 this laptop runs everything on it. Playing Modern Warfare I keep the graphics for the most part on normal settings with certain settings being set to high and I'm averaging around 120 frames per second and even occasionally hitting the refresh rate of the screen itself which is amazing when I compare it to my desktop because it runs it almost as well. And temps are looking great! I had my doubts because the cpu idle temps without making any changes sat anywhere between 60-70 degrees which is a little concerning but it's a powerful processor crammed into this little machine. When playing Modern Warfare the cpu with fans kept on auto did not go above 80 but at the expense of the fans being very loud. I game with a gaming headset though so luckily I don't hear any of it especially when gaming. The GPU idles around 40 and while playing Modern Warfare did not exceed 75 degrees.
Cons: So the main drawback for me is power consumption. The power brick this laptop comes with is a 230w and you'd think it would be enough to keep the battery at 100% while gaming but sadly it does not. While playing Modern Warfare I noticed that my battery was depleting while gaming. It was very slow but it does go down. After about 25 minutes my battery went from 100% to 95% and if I kept playing it would continue to drop. Buy this knowing and expecting to probably have to buy a stronger power brick in the near future. I do not know yet if the laptop would shut off should the battery hit 0% but I doubt it would as the machine is plugged into the wall.
Overall Review: Overall for the specs this machine is absolutely worth it but it comes with an inefficient power brick considering it doesn't even keep the battery full while gaming so that's why it gets a 3 star. It would be 4 out of 5 but a gaming laptop/notebook should absolutely come with a power brick that's capable of keeping the battery sufficiently charged while under use with the parts that are inside the pc.",1.0,6.0,13.0,32.0,36.0,1,1,1

It chokes on most newer games at ultra settings so you'll have to lower settings to get anywhere near the 144 mark. It will only overclock to 408 GB/s before showing artifacts. I'd like to know what is going on with this card and how MSI/Newegg can sell it as a 2070 because it sure doesn't act like one.

Temps stay in check with the CPU in the low 80's and the GPU in the low 70's while gaming. Overclocking the GPU didn't change the temps at all.

1 Good Performance. : - But the credit goes to processor and RTX card, and not to MSI
2 Awesome keyboard:
3 Fans are bearable when not doing heavy work (Thanks) However, turbo mode is super loud. but it is very understandable.
Cons: 1. REAL BAD : The Battery Life. say Bye bye to battery life if you want to buy this laptop. Even when you are just typing on wordpad with all battery super saver on, 20% brightness, mute and low performance mode on. The Battery will die down in 1 and half hour. I wish there was a way to upgrade the battery from 51Whr to 84 Whr.
I mean 51whr for 17'' laptop? come on MSI. At least make sure the battery last for 4 hours for minor tasks like watching you tube videos. It doesn't.

2 Others small issues : -
Touchpad buttons : Are really bad. You have to press them hard and your thumb tips will start hurting if you have a habit of using buttons often.

The laptop external design and quality is Okay. The Entire body is made up of plastic (I really wish it was metal ). I think Laptop might fall apart in couple years. However it was not a tun off for me since I am a careful user.

3 Random suggestion/ ignore :-
On the keyboard the delete key is in the middle top of numpad keys. Which is usually at the corner of num pad or over the backspace button. This is bit inconvenient if you are a programmer or an editor, since it it one of the frequently used keys.
Overall Review: I wish there was a way to upgrade this battery to higher wattage say 84Whrs. I would be really satisfied. This is a high end laptop for me and for most other people. I wanted it to at least good in most areas such as performance, battery life, heat , Fan noise and build quality.

Overall Review: *** Please read this ***
This goes for all memory, please make sure that both your cpu and your motherboard can handle this memory. Simply put, not all combinations of cpu/MB are going to hit 3600, that is NOT the fault of *any* memory manufacturer. For example with a z170 and a 6th gen intel this memory would not go above 3200 Mhz.

Will you hit 3600? With the intended CPU on Z390, Z370, almost certainly yes. Z270 very very likely. Z170 probably not. Ryzen 3 on X570, almost certainly yes. Ryzen 2, maybe. Ryzen 1, no. Just one man's best guess.

Overall Review: I brought this when its price point at $140 and paired it with my Ryzen 3900x, everything ran smoothly without problem. I used DRAM Calculator for Ryzen to get the timing to 16-19-20-36 @ 1.38V in BIOS, stable in a 30 minutes memtest64 stress test. One thing I couldn't measure is the temperature because the ram doesn't have a sensor and my motherboard doesn't it either for memory.

Overall, this is the ideal ram to get with a good price to reach the sweet spot of performance for the Ryzen 3000 cpu, which is DDR4 3600 @ CL16. I don't really see the reason to get the much expensive one, well unless you're one of those RGB guys.",0.0,4.0,4.0,11.0,39.0,1,1,1

My Motherboard (MSI Tomahawk Max) includes a feature called 'Memory try it!' that helped me find the best timings for it.
at 1.39V it was stable at 3600Mhz with 1T 16-19-19-19-39 timing (Tested on Win10 with OCCT / Prime95, then on Linux with memtest86+ for 12H)
Using the 'Advanced DRAM Configuration', I then throttled it back to 1T 17-20-20-20-40 as I would take stability over a little more speed anytime.
1.39V is slightly more than I expected, but both modules run cool to the touch.
Cons: None.

I have it at 3466mhz, 16-18-18-36. I'm not a good memory overclocker, but if you are, these timings probably aren't good.

I have a 13gb ramdisk that is super fast. I have my TEMP and TMP folders there, and internet browsing is sped up tremendously, plus, I don't get so many writes to my SSD's

UPDATE: I recently updated my cpu to a Ryzen 3900x, while updating my ram to 64gb (4x16gb) at the same time, and everything turned out great. The speed won't go as high as before, but my mobo manufacturer warned me of that beforehand when using four dimms versus two. Also, since I bought 2x16gb kits on two separate occasions, there are no guarantees that the kits will work at advertised speeds, and especially in a 4 dimm config, and that's bcuz they weren't tested like that, but I understood that ahead of time. My ram is now running at 3333, 16-18-18-38, stock voltage.

The original kit I bought May 2018, and the next kit April 2020.

With what I do, I haven't seen a performance increase, but I bought this in response to the Corona situation, not knowing if there would be shortages on pc parts in the future.
Cons: Can't blame G Skill, but AMD officially doesn't support these speeds, though some Mobo makers say their boards support it with overclocking.

(Update) If you are not reaching the advertised speeds of 3600mhz for your processor, and unless your kit is defective, then that is not G Skillz fault. They sell kits at different speeds, and some faster that what most mobo makers advertise. Some people can overclock them faster that advertised speeds. If you are having problems with your memory working at Cpu specific speeds, then go watch some videos online, they might help you out.

Cons: Unstable for my setup. Took me a while to discover it was these sticks.
Overall Review: I bought these 32gb sticks to replace a kit of 16gb ripjaws I bought at the height of the memory price hike. I did so on a specific review which stated it ran great on my exact system. At first they seemed to function great. Set the xmp and away I went. However, eventually my computer started behaving really strangely. Random BSOD, quitting games, failing stress tests, corrupted windows files etc. I even went as far as replacing my psu because a lot of the symptoms resembled a failing psu and of course the memory would pass long memtest runs and windows memory diagnostic passes. Eventually, after much wasted time and energy it dawned on me it had to be the ram. I set the ram to it's spec timings and I still had problems. Put my old sticks in and the problems disappeared.

I can't say the sticks are faulty for sure (I believe they are though) because I could never get them to fail a memory test, only stress tests would fail occasionally. I did not run exhaustive tests however. One full pass of memtest which took 12 hours was the max. I have since bought a 32gb kit of gskill flarex and they are performing perfectly. I will say the old 16gb ripjaws kit I have are Samsung b-die. The flarex kit I'm now using is Samsung c-die. This kit was hynix. That may be an issue too for all I know. So in closing, these did not work for me.

With DDR4 - not so much
Cons: Does not reach advertised 3600 speed (stable) on AMD Threadripper 1920X with ASRock Taichi X399
Overall Review: The MAX stable I could reach with the built in BIOS tools (XMP Profiles) was 3466, which I guess it is not that bad, but when the manufacturer advertises 3600 and the memory is on BOTH QVL lists at both AsRock AND G.SKill - one would expect the max to be reached EVERY TIME. However, no such luck.

On my AsRock Taichi X399 with the latest BIOS and Threadripper 1920X (12 cores, 24 threads), it will boot to Windows in 3600, but it is unstable and soon crashes the entire system. If downclocked to 3466 it works fine and is mostly stable (crashes like once a week), but then why is it advertised at 3600+???

Que in the answer from the G.Skill newegg guy below say that 'overclock speeds are not guaranteed' blah,blah, blah etc. but then why do you use them as a marketing gimmick to sell more? Just advertise the actual speeds and let us overclockers achieve whatever we can get!

And don't start about the memory controller (G.Skill customer support had the nerve to mention that!) - the mem controller on Threadripper is STELLAR! The problem is with the RAM.",1.0,7.0,12.0,11.0,39.0,1,1,1

Comfortable for my ears (small tips)
Stays in ear surprisingly well
Connects quickly once paired
Cons: Pairing process can be frustrating
Can only be paired to one device
Charging case isn't as nice as others I have used
Overall Review: Overall a great pair of buds for the price. They have served me well for a year of use and I used them a LOT, however after one year the right bud will no longer turn off when put in the case, keeping it was charging and continuing to drain battery as it plays music. Battery life has been as expected, the more I have used it the shorted a charge would last but I am still getting about 3-3.5 hours on a charge (if I can get it to charge that is)

These are my favorite true wireless buds of the hand full that I have tried, the whole not turning off in the case thing has been frustrating but otherwise have had a great experience with these!",0.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,52.0,1,1,1

Easy to use controls
Cons: Keep losing connection
Difficult pairing procedure
Auto pairing does not always work
Overall Review: Purchased these as reconditioned at a great price. However, in spite of trying all three size ear silicones, the buds keep falling out of my ears, even at low activity level (should have paid attention to other reviews that mention this problem, but have never had that problem with other buds). Low activity level meaning sitting and watching TV.
As well, if I finally get them to pair with my Fire Stick, the connection drops and will not reconnect.

Great for office calls, sound is clear on the other side.
Not bulky.
Fits perfectly.
Never faced any issues with connectivity.
When phone rings and by the time you take out the buds from the box and fit it inside your ear, the buds will be connected and call will be answered.
Never had any issues with battery on normal use.
Refurbished buds looked clean, manual says budd are cleaned and provided with new ear tips
Cons: Sound quality is poor for music.
Keeping the buds inside the box and closing is hard, most of the time the buds needs to be aligned perfectly for the box to be closed.
Had echo issues during call once.
You cannot use the left bud alone.

Overall Review: After reading all the reviews online, I thought I was going to get faulty earbuds however, I got a good pair for a solid price point. A lot of the negative reviews I read mentioned that only one earbud works and at one point I thought I was experiencing that same issue. However, after messing with the buds I realized that I had to turn on the other earbud. Sometimes all that is needed to fix that issue was just restarting the earbuds themselves.

Other con includes the Siri functionality only working a third of the time, the microphone being useless when there's wind, and the left earbud not working unless the right one is also on and paired.

Cons: The Sound+ app for phone/tablet was frustrating to use. It took multiple times for it to find the earbuds which were already paired with the phone.
Overall Review: Good quality. Excellent sound.
Unfortunately, they would not stay in my ears. I don't have the right size cartilage 'ear hook' that they depend upon for staying connected when 'twisted in'. also, my right ear canal is slightly collapsed so its position/orientation does not align well with the part of the earbud that is supposed to fit snugly inside.

Great sound
Pass through hearing is amazing
Never slipped or moved once during runs
push button controls instead of touch (which I hate)
Sound quality of calls and microphone is great
Quality of construction is great - and they are comfortable
Case (itself) charges fast - like crazy fast. It's only good for a couple of full charges of the buds - but that's alright.
Cons: When you take a bud out and it pauses your music (awesome feature), (However) if you don't put it back in again in 15 seconds, it won't restart your music - have to cancel out of the program and start it again to get sound. no amount of clicking either headset will get the music to play again. I found it easier to pause the music manually. maybe an iOS problem - not sure.

Wireless charging case (isnt') I hear they are coming out with one - or they may have already.
Overall Review: I've had a number of earbuds - primarily I want to use them for running and sport, and quite a few have failed me - either because they won't stay connected to my phone or my watch while running or turning my head - or they just don't like sweat or water that much. If buds seem to fit, they have poor sound quality, if I find some with good sound quality they never stay in my ears... The one pair I have that does both, I cannot get wet.. These however have had no issue at all staying put, they have excellent sound and the hear-through feature is amazing and such a great idea, if for nothing else - safety.

the app for jabra to control them is so amazing tooo. they're great
Cons: the volume up down is a little dumb cuz i keep pushing it into my ear. and it's hard to manually turn them off without activating the blue tooth pairing. so the only real way to turn them off is the case. other than that nothing. be careful though. if you're near something magnetic it does affect them and turns them on/off. like if you're on the c train and near one of the mechanical rooms it affects it or if you walk though one of those store security detectors
Overall Review: id recommend these to anyone who wants a professional sounding headphone that you can control the EQ on. they're amazing.",0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,52.0,1,1,1

I downloaded the full owner's manual from Jabra's website and used it for setup in place of the 4 page postage stamp size manual that came with them. They worked perfectly right out of the box, paired easily with my iPad Touch. The only downside is the Jabra app won't load to the iPad so I downloaded the app and paired the ear phones to my Android phone to to make adjustments and check for software updates.

Overall Review: These earbuds are really quite a pair. They have great protection against water and sweat, have good battery life, and even fit in my very small ear canals. The sound quality is really quite good for both music and pod casts, and the case is small enough to fit in a pocket. The case has provided, on average, 3-5 charges per charge and they charge very quickly which is great when you take them out and forget to put them back in the case or turn them off.

Cons: Used Acronis True Image 2020 on a complete rebuild and it failed twice. The first time it gave a failure stating that the backups were corrupted.

It is easy to install, simple to set up and the rescue media is a snap. If you are on windows, choose the Linux mode and it works perfectly to boot your devices.
Cons: I purchased the 5 computer license and was told by the vendor it shipped a physical 'disc' and the key. NOPE, waited 5 business days and all that arrived is a box with a piece of paper: instructions on how to DOWNLOAD the software and then enter the key they shipped. This is not really an issue, but I took one egg because customer service was wrong about what would ship and I specifically asked if this was the case.

The other con is that the advanced features such as using your phone to access files on the computer is a subscription on top of the license, nowhere did it say that prior to purchasing. VERY MISLEADING!

Cons: It would take about ten pages to document all the flaws in this product. You can't rename a job after Acronis assigns a ludicrously complex name to it. If you manually delete a backup file, Acronis complains about it, and won't let you modify the job. If you try to add a backup file, it claims the file (that it just created) is locked or corrupt. If you try to contact ""support"", you are asked to login, but then it refuses your login because you didn't reply to a verification email that was never sent. The restore procedure is a (bad) joke. Although EaseUS Todo backup has its own flaws, and less features, the features it has work; so I'm going back to Todo. Now I understand why Newegg won't accept returns for this highly-defective product.

I've been using this program for over 2 years and have never had another but good tidings about it. All of my programs have been cloned with no issues or hiccups. My first year of having it something happened to my computer where it reverted back to when I first booted it up when I first built it.

You will now be disappointed with this if you use it.

Overall Review: The boxed version of this is the way to go. I've tried the downloaded version of this and although 1 version is fine, DON'T go for the multiple licenses because there's a flaw where you WILL NOT get all the licenses you paid for and then you have to contact NEWEGG to get your money back.

- RGB Colors are super bright and vibrant. Of all the RGB in my new build, these are the best.
- The white is stupid awesome in my build. :)
Cons: - Nothing as of yet. Works as intended.
Overall Review: I was dreading trying to find the ram I needed for my new Ryzen build, and when I found these, I decided to jump and see what happened. These being white is what made me buy them, as my build is a white theme. Right out of the box they only ran at 2666, but after a quick and painless BIOS update to my B350 motherboard they fired up at 3200 and has worked flawlessly since.

The colours and the LEDs are bright and easy to look at, with the software not being a pain to use.
Cons: The set up was fairly time consuming. The XMP would not work on the ram (i'm using a Ryzen) so had to do the timings manually. (this is mostly my fault, I'm dumb.)
Overall Review: I would recommend this to other people if you want a nice easy looking ram that's fast and decently priced. The latency is good on this thing, but if you run into problems with setting up the ram eg; it's stuck at 2133mhz, look on the actual ram on itself. Check the label and copy literally everything from it. In my experience, it was 16 - 18 - 18 - 36 timings and 1.35 voltage. Go to your BIOS, set that and set your voltage value to 1.350 or 1.35.",0.0,6.0,6.0,9.0,44.0,1,1,1

Cons: Lost an egg only because it’s on AMDs approved list but the rgb doesn’t work with Aura Sync. You have to use the Corsair iCue. Also the rgb reacts a little “blocky”. Best way I can describe that. But it’s quite pretty and has lots of adjustments so I only took away 1 egg.

My impressions with this ram are great, I changed one bios configuration (xmp on) from a drop down menu no less, and achieved rated speeds. I have the lights set to default rainbow because changing that is kind of a pain. I have downloaded and installed Corsair iCue, and it works, but I have to enable a setting that voids the warranty on my ram to do a custom lighting effect that I really want.

- The white heat spreaders look nice
- RGB looks really nice and iCue has a lot of different effects
Cons: - This set of RAM run QUITE a bit hotter than previous G.Skill DDR4 that I've used. At idle it typically sits around 32*C with RGB on and while gaming it will get close to 50*C which is still within spec but quite a bit warmer than I'd like. Especially when the G.Skill Ripjaws V sticks that these replaced typically stayed under 40*C even when gaming.
- Not very good for overclocking past advertised specs, and haven't been able to get the timings lower than advertised

Overall Review: My setup is an MSI Mortar Titanium, Ryzen 5 3600, Sabrent 1tb m.2 NVME drive, 512gb Samsung SSD and an Asus 980 ti Strix.
Great ram for the price if you get a kit that actually runs at the rated 3200mhz. After a couple tests and looking at the bios, mine was clocked at 2133 and userbenchmark showed them running at 1033 iirc. Overclocking just resulted in failure to boot and I had to flash the bios to make it work again. I requested an exchange from newegg and had to send them back before getting a new kit which sucks since it's my only pc and it'll be down for a couple weeks. I'll update once I get the new kit if it was just random bad silicone.",0.0,0.0,1.0,9.0,44.0,1,1,1

I personally play Forza Horizon 4, and at max settings this GPU runs at around 90-120fps (1080p) when paired with an i5-10400.
- Relatively quiet when not gaming. Fan noise is not very noticeable when gaming.
- Small form factor, fits in smaller cases.
- Attractive graphics card, rigid back plate.
- Price! For RTX cards this GPU is relatively cheap.
Cons: - Coil whine. Like most other reviews my card has a slight coil whine when playing graphically intense games. For example, Outer Wilds on max settings will run at a solid 60fps capped, however coil whine will occur when looking at more graphically-intense areas.
- Temperatures. Most games that I play (Cities skylines, Forza horizon 4, Transport fever, No Man's Sky) will have the card running around 45-60* C, however more intense games (Outer Wilds) will have the card running around 70-80* C.
Overall Review: Overall great for the price. Coil whine can be bothersome, however I feel for the performance and price this card seems worth it. This would get a five egg review otherwise.

Once it started on the third part of the scan, a high pitched buzz came from my card, before the DisplayPorts (yes all of them) stopped functioning. It took me an hour or so to figure out I had to power cycle my PC, including turning off my PSU and discharging it completely with holding the power button down for at least 5 seconds, before turning everything back on.

Having purchased it to be on the forefront of raytracing, I was expecting moderate framerate (60 at the highest) and I was pleasantly surprised. In Minecraft's RTX beta, I was actually able to maintain a consistent 60FPS (alongside 16GB of RAM and a Ryzen 5 2600). Yes, it did dip down at times but only when trying to fly great distances. Walking in the RTX Beta worlds did not dip down much below 59.

If you're just looking for a beefy card to generally play games, this one will serve you justice and then some. I have yet to find a drop in frames in non-RTX games that fell below 55 or so and that's including Star Wars Battlefront II at the second highest settings. I'm still confident I could increase that, but instability with the PSU has kept me from testing that.
Cons: You will need power. A good deal of power. I'm running a Thermaltake 650W 80+ Gold and it may not be enough. Though, I'm working on figuring out if those few system crashes is actually just a faulty PSU. Just for absolute certainty, go for at least 750W 80+ Gold. Anything higher and you should be golden.

With this being my second PC built, I would also be on the watch for any PCIe slot wear and tear from its weight. I'd recommend reinforcing the far end of the card, it is not 2080 heft but it's pretty beefy. That's just a best practice recommendation, a potential con in the long run. But, not unexpected. This isn't meant to be a low profile card.

Cons: Coil whine. It sucks when you get a card with it but it’s not that big of a deal. Only occurs under heavy load and can be mitigated by limiting framerate OR using Medium/High settings at high framerate.

Performance has greatly improved on my computer. Very quiet and software installation very easy.
Cons: Installing into my Dell Precision T5600 tower was tricky. The door to the desktop tower had an extended ""handle"" that was in the exact same place as the graphic card. So I had to take a hammer and chizzle to pop the riveted handle off the door of the tower. I understand this is not the Graphic Card issue, but I did find it very unusual that the power supply was located on the top surface of the Graphic card. This make for very little room between the graphics card and the door of the desktop tower. So even after I removed the ""handle"" from the door...it was very tight fit into the tower.

Rubber bumper ring on each magnet ensures that it closes nice and quiet!

With the Dual Chamber Layout there is plenty of room to hide a ton of wires, with metal loops in the frame for using ties if needed. Soft rubber grommets offer snag free pass through for running wires.

Bottom of case features a slide out screen filter for easy cleaning. Optional top screen included that mounts inside case with magnetic mount if you are not planning on using a radiator. Drive mounting and PS side of case also has an easily removable mesh screen filter that is also magnetic mount for easy removal and cleaning.

Future proofed with a USB-C port and cable for connecting to existing motherboards that have this feature and 2 x USB 3.0 with Audio plug located on top of case with lighted power button.

The 2 vertical slots in back give you the option to mount your graphics card vertically which is really nice, but this leaves less than 1 inch of clearance between the glass panel and the fans on your GPU. You will need to order a kit if you plan on mounting your GPU vertically as no kit is included!

Maximum supported GPU card length is just a bit less than 13 inches.

Accommodates large/small power supplies with an adjustable boot bracket for the base of the PS. Keep in mind that if you have a PS with RGB lights you will be limited to how much light can pass through the side vent screen.

Multiple radiator mounting options! And up to seven 140mm fans can be mounted on the front, back, top or bottom, or eight 120mm fans.

Included CORSAIR Lighting Node PRO supports up to 7 RGB fans or RGB LED light strips, powered by CORSAIR iCUE software.
Cons: No mounting hardware is included for mounting a graphics card vertically. While these kits are inexpensive, they could have thrown in the kit for this price!

No fan mounting options on drive mounting side chamber.
Overall Review: I would recommend this case for those that love a custom build that allows you to show off all your gear and lights! Tons of room with excellent airflow throughout the motherboard area!!",0.0,17.0,18.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

- The build quality is excellent and everything fits well. The materials have premium feel with excellent paint job. The top and front have real glass covers. The left side cover is also made of glass and swivels on well made hinges. There is no lock. Rather, the side door is secured in place by strong magnets.
- Magnetic dust covers on the top and bottom of the case.
- Dual chamber design allows for excellent cooling of the motherboard.
- Dual chamber design allows all the cabling to be hidden for wonderful aesthetics.
- Lightning Node Pro hardware can handle 6 fans (3 front RGB fans are already installed).
- The front fans can be programmed via i-Cue software to perform wide variety of effects.
- The included Corsair fans are very quiet.
- 8 expansion slots (plus 2 vertical slots)
- 2 USB 3.0, one USB type C and and audio out ports on top of the case.
-The case can accept ITX, MATX, ATX or E-ATX motherboards.
- Four 2.5 internal hard drive bays.
- Three 3.5 internal hard drive bays (each can accept 2.5 drives instead).
- L W H of 423mm, 344mm, 505mm.
Cons: - No external 5.25 expansion bays.
- I am not a big fan of Corsair’s solution for mounting internal 3.5 hard drives. I find the plastic trays hard to remove and easy to damage.
Overall Review: - I loved building a PC around this case. It was very easy to install all the components. The cables can be hidden out of sight. Before you buy this case though, ensure you have enough space for it at your place as the dual chamber 680X case is rather large.
- The left chamber is made for motherboard (and its components) and is well-ventilated with 3 front RGB 120mm fans preinstalled (replaceable by two 140mm fans). There is one 120mm fan in the rear (replaceable by one 140mm fan). The top can be fitted with two 120 or 140mm fans. The bottom can be fitted with two 120 or 140mm fans. If you wish to fit the case with water cooling: the front can take one 360 or 280mm radiator. The top can take one 280 or 240mm radiator. The rear can be fitted with a 120mm radiator. And the bottom can be fitted with one 280 or 240mm radiator.
- The right chamber has space for bottom-mounted, vertically-oriented PSU (ATX up to 225 mm). The PSU draws fresh air through the perforated opening on the side door.
- The right chamber contains two hard drive cages. The inside of the right chamber is not visible from the outside and is meant to conceal cable management and Lightning Node Pro hardware. Since all the cabling is concealed, the case has wonderful aesthetics.
- Aside from PSU drawing fresh air directly from the outside, there are no fans in the right chamber.
-If you use air cooler with your CPU, you probably will not be able to use tower taller than 150 mm.
- The max GPU length is probably 12 inches (300 mm) with the existing fans.
- The Corsair Crystal 680X will allow you to build a PC with excellent cooling characteristics in a visually pleasing package. There is plenty of room for the components and its easy to conceal the cabling. On top of that, 680X was one of the easiest cases to work on.",0.0,4.0,5.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1
Corsair Crystal Series 680X RGB CC-9011168-WW Black Steel / Plastic High Airflow Tempered Glass ATX Smart Case,76.0,4,259.99,william r.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,3/3/19 19:19,5.0,"Pros: Today I am going to be reviewing the Corsair 680x RGB computer case. I have the one that is white and I have to say that its sharp looking. It's a full out white not some white off gray. I got this case for my wife as she needs a new build and she absolutely loves the pop of the white. It's a full sized case so if you're looking for some small form factor this is not the case for you. If you're looking for a case that will not cramp your style when you're looking to build a new gaming unit this is the case for you. I really like the fact that the case buttons are on the top of the case and not on the face, it gives the case a more finished look
It has great air flow and has more than enough room in it for a closed liquid cooling system. The glass side panel is easy to remove and makes it easy to see into the case to unsure you have no leaks or you can add some extra lights and show off your mood. This case is very modular and it was easy to do my cable management and competent setup in.
I had no issue installing and managing my two large video cards and was able to match the case color to my heat sink fan color ""Red"" over all I am very happy with the case and would say buy it if you were on the fence. It's a great case. The RGB was not why I got this case but it really adds that extra pop to it.
Cons: The only real con to this case is the thumb screws that hold the side panels on. I am come on you can't give me a full aluminum screw that complement the case? If I had the ear of Corsair I would make sure that they add finished thumb screws to all of their cases.
Overall Review: There are not a lot of reviews on this case and I am not sure why? It's a great case for the money, its big, roomy, great air flow and RGB what more do you want from a case?",0.0,3.0,4.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1
Corsair Crystal Series 680X RGB CC-9011168-WW Black Steel / Plastic High Airflow Tempered Glass ATX Smart Case,76.0,4,259.99,Brandon B.,Ownership: 1 day to 1 week,Verified Owner,1/22/20 13:09,3.0,"Pros: The overall quality of the case is nice.
Cons: UPDATE: Just to save anyone who buys this case from unecessary annoyance. The top dust filter for this case comes loose in the box (which is strange considering the other 2 come pre-installed). At first glance it appears useless as it does not fit in the top slot. The ""directions"" supplied indicate (just by pictures, no actual description), that it rests on the top slot. It does not. You have to install it yourself from *inside* the case. There is a separate panel that you have to remove from inside in order to get it to fit in the proper slot.

*However*, as one other review mentioned, it comes with a completely mis-sized top dust filter. Like its not even close to be able to fit in the slot, way too big, i have to think its just the completely wrong part number included in the box. Also the front top RGB fan on mine arrived defective. The outer ring of the fan has no illumination at all (yes i double checked all the connections and rgb config settings). I have have two open tickets with corsair to send replacement parts, which have gone unanswered so far. Hopefully they make it right.
Overall Review: As long as everything gets replaced correctly its a solid case.",0.0,14.0,14.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1
Corsair Crystal Series 680X RGB CC-9011168-WW Black Steel / Plastic High Airflow Tempered Glass ATX Smart Case,76.0,4,259.99,Anonymous,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,6/15/19 13:10,4.0,"Pros: This case just looks fantastic. I'm almost done with my build and can hardly wait to see what it looks like lit up. There is plenty of space for fans, I have 8 RGB fans installed in the front compartment. On the back side is a good size compartment. It holds the PSU along with the drive cages. It also has your connectors for any RGB lighting and led strips you want to do. This back compartment makes wiring the front of the case very easy with 8 grommeted holes give easy access to your motherboard. It's easy to install an AIO water cooling radiator. Please stick to 120-240 or 360 radiators. ( see cons ) This case is a dream to work on if you plan out what you want in it.
Cons: Okay this case looks fantastic, but it should have been about 2 inches longer than the 16.25 inches from front to back, and 1 or 2 inches taller than it's 19.25 height without feet. The width of 13.125 inches is fine. The spec diagram shows that you can put 1-2 and 3 fan radiators in the front. Do not get the 2 fan 140mm units they only fit in the top 2 or bottom 2 positions in front, they can't be centered. If you mount a radiator in front at the top, you cannot use two 140mm fans in the top of the case. These must be centered, they can't be moved forward or back to miss the front radiator. They will fit in the bottom, the hoses will pass over the front of your graphics card and obstruct the view slightly. Two 140mm fans can be mounted in the bottom with no problem. A 140mm fan will fit in the back, I suggest it for moving more heat out of the case. As I said in the Pros of this review, the back compartment is huge compared to most cases you see on the market. The PSU is mounted on its side and draws air from a large vent in the side panel. The three 3.5 "" Harddrive bays are also on their side, with 4 removable SSD cages on top of that, you can remove 2 of them and have about 3 "" on top for cable management. This takes up just over 1/3rd of the space in back. You get a Corsair Lighting Node Pro, and an RGB 6 plug fan hub. The hub is required if you want to run RGB fans. If you get two models of fans, they come in ML, LL, SP, and HD, you must have a separate RGB fan hub for each type. They are small and as I said, for RGB control a requirement, they are also about $40 dollars a piece if you don't buy them in a multi-fan kit. The wiring can be kept neat, but to do so, you need to spend some time planning the wire routes out ahead of time. Just time consuming.
Overall Review: To sum up. This case looks great, with planning your front compartment will be un-cluttered, only showing off your design skills. Outside of the two inches front to back and top to bottom, this case is The Bomb. My case is white, the theme is Black, White and RGB. I wish it was finished so I could post a pictures, if they allow pictures. I could do this again, I have no problem recommending it.",0.0,5.0,5.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

plenty of room and pass-through sport for cable management
Nice pre-installed HDD and SSD storage space and bays
Lovely and big RGB Case Fans
Cons: The top dust filter screen did not fit the top slot
magnets on it were installed crookedly
Overall Review: This overall was a very nice and spacious case, with plenty of room for components, wire management, water cooling and anything else you could probably put in it. I really like the design of have the PCI and storage separated from the main components to help give it a nice cleaner look and feel.

my only real complaint is with the magnetic dust filters, the top one in particular. It was the only one that didn't come already installed into the machine and it feels like it was just kind half haphazardly tossed into the box. The magnets that were ""fitted"" to it were not even lined up striated and were also two big to fit in the slot on the top where the filter was supposed to go. I had to end up forcing it down, which made it bulge up on the side instead of laying flat like other dust filters. It not a huge issue for me as I have my fans blowing out through the top of the case, but if you set yours up to pull air from the top into the case it might be an issue for you",0.0,4.0,4.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

- 3 RGB LL120 fans front mounted, 1 Non Rgb 120mm fan mounted in rear
- Overall design and aesthetics are great
- Will manage most design layouts without any issue
-Case keeps cool with an RTX 2060 Super
Cons: - 2 design flaws, one is the top magnetic screen that does not fit as it should and you'll have to cut it as most have stated
- Hard drive cage for 3.5 drives blocks some motherboards from utilizing PCIe slot 1 as it blocks the card from being seated correctly-no way to move hard drive cage
- For an RGB novice better directions are needed for the RGB and Led power connector
Overall Review: Overall I'd recommend the case with the above listed caveats, it's a great case beside those items and is large but stuns when everything is connected and lit up. Temps for the case with a H115i on the new I7-10700k are about 25-28 idle and barely touch 39-45 when gaming, airflow seems solid. But for the price I paid, I would have expected the hard drive case and dust filters to not have the listed issues.",0.0,3.0,3.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

Makes for a very clean look. Comes with the fan controller modules so you don't have to buy an extra one when outfitting it with corsair lighting fans. For reference I purchased Corsair LL120 fans to plug into the controller.
Cons: Would have liked a couple more case mounted usb connectors
Overall Review: This is the first case I've purchased in 19 years. Yep, that isn't a typo. When I'd build a new computer, I'd use my trusty Antec full tower that has slide out cases for drives and put the new guts in. With all the stuff going into a machine now it was becoming very crowded. Video cards barely fit, couldn't get drives out, and the cables, no matter how much I tried to manage them, became a mess. It was time for a new one and a friend had the smaller brother of this case and I loved the idea of the seperate area to keep cables and stuff out of the way so you can easily work inside and have great airflow since I don't have cables blocking everything.

Highly recommended. Either this or one in this series.",0.0,3.0,3.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

- Hinged glass door is sweet - easy access all day - held close with magnets
- Removable front fan tray and top AIO tray with filters is actually a nice addition.
Cons: - Poor airflow if used as pictured
- A few tweaks from manufacturer would have made this the best
- Needs to be 1"" longer - Asus Strix 2080TI power cable rubs on front fans - AIO hoses also hit the top fan of the front intake fans.
- Needs to be one inch taller - Using EVGA 280MM AIO (which is fairly thing) mounted in the top case position the cooling fans actually hit against the MOBO 8 pin connectors - It is a bit too tight of a fit
Overall Review: - I would recommend this case if you like to tinker and make decent things better. With the glass paneling on the top and front the airflow is below average (see gamersnexus review on youtube). I removed the front and top glass panels altogether. I also added two 140mm fans into the top of the AIO that sit on top of the case, inside fans in push, and top fans in pull. I manufactured a custom top mesh panel out of steel mesh which allows the fans to exhaust the AIO air. I left the front as is using the filter they sent after removing the glass. 120mm fans in front work OK, because they are so close to the AIO tubing, and the Asus Strix 2080ti GPUs i felt that they weren't pushing in enough air to the case so i replaced them with 3ea 140mm Fans. The instructions say only two can be mounted in the front but it was easily moddable. With the changes ive made i am seeing 70 degree C temps on a 3950x overclocked to 4.5 ghz on all cores, and two 2080ti in sli over clocked to 2100mhz. The tempered side door is excellent but it would have been nice to have acrylic (I will probably replace with acrylic and 200mm intake fan over the gpus). I noticed that non SLI games keep my temps at 60 degrees C at full load, as soon as SLI goes in use temps go up alot from the insane 2080ti's backplate heating up the entire system. I prefer mid 70s C to be the highest temps for my components.",1.0,2.0,2.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

Corsair Crystal Series 680X RGB CC-9011168-WW Black Steel / Plastic High Airflow Tempered Glass ATX Smart Case,76.0,4,259.99,Robert M.,Ownership: less than 1 day,Verified Owner,9/22/19 20:09,5.0,"Pros: Plenty of space to fit anything you'd want in your rig while also giving the ability to hide most wires. Beautiful design for an RGB system that also comes with a hub to control fans. The iCue software to control the RGB is the best that I've come across and made me want to get other Corsair products (K95 keyboard, Glaive mouse, MM800 pad, H115 Platinum cooler) to make it all work together. It's not perfect, but it's pretty close.
Cons: This is advertised as a high airflow case, but there is hardly any space for that air to flow through the front where the three main fans are, so I decided to brake out the glass and replace it with my own custom crafted acrylic front panel which not only improved the flow, but looks cooler too. Later, I found some dust starting to gather on the grills over the fans, so pulling off the panels to get to them was easier because of the replacement.
Overall Review: This case is a great combination of design and beauty for an ok price (for what you get). One things I think Corsair could improve on would be the airflow through the front. I think if they would cut the spiral design of their iCue logo into the glass over the fans, it would make for a much better flow and show off their design. A quick release for that panel would also be a good idea. I stuffed a x570 Gigabyte Aorus Xtreme mobo, Waterforce 2080 ti, 3900x, 64 gigs of Gskill Trident Z Royals (3200 cl14) powered by a Corsair HX1000 and this case shows it all off nicely while hiding the wires (& PSU). One other thing I would like to see would be if we could get the iCue software to control the RGB of non Corsair products, like my mobo, ram, and video card so that I could switch all lighting profiles with one button (on my keyboard). I find it a bit odd that it can see these items in the iCue panels, but not control the RGB. This build should last me at least a decade with some small upgrades.",0.0,2.0,2.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

Lots of it. It's not a super tower like the cosmos 2 I had but i feel i have more room in this case due to the extra chamber where the PSU goes. The chassis is solidly built and i experienced no flex at all while man handling it about the room trying to get everything in it.

I'm only using standard atx motherboard with a 240mm aio cooler and have so much room. I have a total of ten fans running however, the three stock RGB, 3 more SP(?) I forget RGB fans and the two Cooler Master RGB AIO fans pushing with 2 standard non RGB corsair fans pulling. So plenty of airflow keeps temps upper 50c while under load and 30 LCD and less while idle.

Now I have the drive bays out as I have no standard or ssd drives mounted. I am using 2 NVME drives instead. This makes cable management a breeze and adding the second RGB hub for the other fans as well. There are plenty of pass through areas so wiring is a breeze and with the front, and top fan trays being removable saved time if you need to swap a fan out or mount radiators.

There are only two slots for vertically mounting a gpu which isnt a huge deal unless you have a 3 slot card. Bit of modifications helped that out. Plenty of screens to keep dust to a minimum on bottom intake front and top (though my top are exhaust so I don't use that one..

The tempered glass is thick, amd the door slips off the hinges easily enough for any removal needs. I would have liked more case mounted usb, but its whatever.
Cons: Only con here is the price. The Thermaltake tower 900 is about the same price and bigger so I'm kinda mad I didnt get it and the 20 ht is less... and I really like that case. I just forgot about it. So... check all three out of your looking for big and feature rich.

Easy to get into the filters and great way to manage your cables. Love the door that opens at the front to allow easy access to do maintenance or upgrades. For my desk, this seemed like a downgrade, but this was a perfect fit for my desk. I went with the black steel version, so worked well with my equipment selection which is a darker build, and with my black Corsair LL140s. I left the 120s in the front and this thing stays nice and cool.
Cons: If you have video card sag, and you install fans in the bottom of the case, makes installing a brace extremely difficult if you install your card in the lower positions of your MOBO. This case does allow vertical installation but you are relying on the bracket on the back of the GPU to hold in place, which for my GPU sags a little. Some form of bracket would be beneficial in this configuration to support the GPU. And yes, in this configuration, some brackets will fit. Last, the instructions are extremely vague. I have read other comments for folks trying to figure out how to install the top filter, which is actually easy to do. Inside the case, toward the top, there are two thumb screws you undo and slide the bracket out which gives access for installing your radiator/fans and the filter, with no hassle. The instructions could help with a little more detail in these instances, based on the number of comments left I reviewed. Same with the door removal, which is held by one screw on the top hinge and slid off during mods.
Overall Review: I obviously don't build a ton of computers, but this is my favorite case by far. Plus, reviewing other cases and designs, I like this layout the best as it has a really nice look, cooling and managing cables. Easy to work with, and as stated earlier, I love the door on the front that pops right open without screws or other securing hardware. The case does come with 4 corsair fans, which messes with cost as I am sure part of the cost of this case are these fans. This is great if you are ok with 120s, but if you want to upgrade then you have spare fans sitting around.",0.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

- beautiful aesthetics
- Even with the glass panels it gets enough airflow to cool everything down and can absolutely move hot air quick and out the case.
Cons: - Bit expensive
- doesn't come with a corsair pro module which is not super necessary but for the cost of the case I think they should throw it in.
If you want to do a push pull config on your AIO cooler, space is a bit limited thanks to the glass panels (you could do it but the space between the glass and the fan is gonna be severely reduced, like totally touching the glass unless you get low profile fans) but in my opinion it doesn't need a push pull.

Overall Review: Would definitely recommend this case if you have to money to blow on it, because it is pretty expensive.

- Aesthetically pleasing
- Comes with great fans setup, with plenty of expansion room
Cons: - The case is not achieving maximum airflow, because of the large pane of glass in the front. It's not terrible in any sense, just not what merits a ""high air flow"" designation. I could've forgiven this if it was some cheapo company - but, it's Corsair.
- It would've been nice to offer a fan mount on the power/cable section.
- Offering a white glass door to match the rest of the case (like the smaller version)

-Allows for a bottom mount radiator which helps keep my cpu running very cool.
-I really like the space on the closed side for the storage of and hiding of wiring, which allows for a very clean interior.
-Big enough to fit nearly any GPU.
Cons: -It is big and bulky.
-I purchased a separate set of stands to keep this case elevated to allow for good airflow underneath the case (not necessarily too big of a con, just an extra cost).
-One of the pricier cases out there.
Overall Review: This is the best case I've ever owned and would highly recommend if you don't mind the size. I actually bought it for the size, which allowed the GPU that I'd purchased to fit, as well as the number of fans I was able to use to keep the machine running cool. With a radiator on top of 3 intake and 3 exhaust fans, the GPU runs cool all the time. Running Call of Duty on all max settings, the GPU barely cracks 60 degrees celcius, which I at least partially attribute to the high airflow of this case. Great design.",0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

Airflow on this case is great too.
Cons: The only cons i have for this case is hoping they come out with a version that uses 360mm radiator support for the top and bottom like they did with the front panel, or even added more room for a 240mm radiator to fit correctly without conflicting with the front radiator or fans,and better wire management support, So i would say if the case was just 120mm longer and just a tad bit higher this would be a super great case, not that it isn't already.

I had the previous gen of this case, so I'm especially loving the minor details like the swiveling clear panel that easily opens/closes via magnet. For me, this is the perfect case.
Cons: None of the RGB lighting of the front fans works.

I've tried everything to get the fans to light up, but to no avail. As fans, they function fine, but the RGB functionality isn't working. The system comes with the fans already wired up to the RGB Hub and Node Pro, respectively. I've traced all the wires to make sure there were no apparently connectivity issues, exposed wires, etc.

I've tried plugging each fan individually into the first port of the RGB hub and configured appropriately in iCUE (Lighting Channel 1, LL RGB Series Fans, 1 Fan), but nothing. I force-updated the same firmware version via iCUE and restarted the computer, just to see if that would change anything. Nada. My Corsair mouse (M65 Pro) works just fine, though.

I'm in no position to take this system apart to replace the case, nor am I about to shell out money for 3 new fans, a new RGB Hub, and a new Node Pro, to try to figure out which one of these things (even if just the cable of one of them) the issue resides with. I'm super-bummed out by this.
Overall Review: I wish I could go 3 and a half eggs given the circumstances I've found myself in. If the RGB lighting worked, this would be a 5-egg rating from me all day, because I absolutely love everything about the case otherwise. Naturally, my scenario here probably isn't the norm, so you'd likely be fine to order one. But just beware that, if you can somehow test this before you complete your build, then you might want to go ahead and do so.",0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,39.0,1,1,1

-I didn’t like the fact they mounted both the lightning node pro and the rgb hub. Let the customer mount that where they want to in my opinion.
-The hard drive/ssd bays are pretty flimsy, but they work. I do like the semi modular function.
-The lightning node pro I received with my case does not work. Luckily I had an extra one. Removing it from the mounting point was quite annoying. If I get this replaced, I will change to 5 stars.

- Top components, multiple layouts, HDD/SSD/server layout is a godsend for anybody with lots of drives
- Everything ships nicely organized.
- Lots of screws included. The rubber grommets for the drive sleds are great and a necessity for HDDs
- Nice to see a case that still has a 5.25"" bay
- USB-C port on the front is great
- Dual config top for vents/rad or noise reduction
- Plenty of holes/slots/ties for cable managing
- Fan control at the top is nice, although makes tucking cables very tight
Cons: - Manual is pretty weak, even the online one is just the manual in pdf. You can figure it out, but a better one would've sped up the process.
-Some of the screws that are already in case that you have to move for mounting stuff strip the white paint when you remove them, I'm guessing they were just overly tightened on assembly at the factory. Kinda stinks when you are building and you have metal shavings everywhere off a few screws that are also in danger of being stripped due to being too tightened.
- The case fans included are NOT pwm fans, just regular DC despite there being a fan controller

Not going to dock any points off for, but slightly disappointing for these things considering the price

Also worth nothing, that because it's such a big case, it's a tight stretch for 24-pin & 8-pin from the PSU to the board if you don't have a long enough cable/non-modular PSU. Luckily mine made it tightly, possibly something to keep in mind for those before they purchase.

Also if your board doesn't have a USB-c port, then the front is of course useless, so you may have to spend a little more on a 2-port board to really maximize the front i/o, since most boards usually only have 1
Overall Review: Overall, still one of the best cases out there, I can only image what the XL model is like. Very robust for different configs. I used it for many HDDs, but used the sleds and removed the drive cage on the bottom for better airflow. You are getting your money's worth on material and build quality.",0.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: Fantastic case! I'm coming from a Define R5 and there are some significant upgrades. I will never buy a case other than Fractal Design. They understand how to design cases. I put a MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk Wifi motherboard in it and everything went great. I appreciate that there is an option to put an optical drive in it. I watch blu-rays, burn blu-rays, and also burns CDs. Optical Drives are not an option on so many other cases these days. Airflow is decent with stock fans though adding a fan to top pulling out really improved it significantly. I'm using a Noctua NH-U14S cooler. I wish there was mesh door option. This would really improve airflow. I open the door while gaming. I was considering a Meshify S2 but optical drive is not an option and front panel has 2 less USB ports.",0.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,6.0,1,1,1

I think the case might be quieter than others because of dampening material on the back panel and the front door.
- The finished build is very clean and cables can be routed nicely.
Cons: - The case is rather heavy for its size, which makes it a bit difficult to push in and out from under a desk if there is carpet. It would be great if the case had wheels.
- The front panel USB cables are quite stiff and the slot where the cables enter the main compartment is located very close to the USB socket, making if very difficult to plug the front panel USB cables into an ATX motherboard. It would be easier if the cable slot were located a few mm farther from the motherboard.

Cons: heavy without electronics installed
heavier with electronics installed
Overall Review: Where do I start. I thought about getting the XL version but I'm glad I didn't. This case is very big. I do see the benefits of such room because it was very easy to install everything after the first item, the motherboard. Before I realized there was no removal of the motherboard tray I thought, well, this will be interesting to deal with, yet the top comes off to give ease for video card, CPU heat sink, RAM and everything else to install.

I opted to install the heat sink base after securing the motherboard. The cutout behind the motherboard is very large so It gave me no trouble securing it. Cable management is easy to deal with, and allows for them to be hidden behind the motherboard mounting deck.

Black. Did I mention the word ""black?"" Everything in and on this case is black. Cables - black. Outside - black. Motherboard standoffs - black. Rivets - black. Front panel buttons - black. I love black so I'm more than satisfied and surprised at the all of the black this case has.

- Having to refund/return the case because I didn't read the fine print on this thing, I guess. Newegg or Fractal Design needs to remove ""E-ATX"" from this case if it won't actually hold those boards.
Overall Review: I couldn't give you a yes or no on the case. It seems like a nice case from all the reviews, but not actually being an EATX board is frustrating from my personal perspective.

The modularity of this case is fantastic. The ease of removing the panels, reconfiguring it to/from storage mode, etc. are all a wonderful part of this case. The multiple top panel selection that's included is also great.

The ability to mount bottom fans is also a huge plus for me and something you don't see in nearly enough cases, in my opinion. And then there's the built in fan hub (See also Cons) and all the room to do whatever you want.

The lack of front panel mesh is, to me, a huge plus. I'm not a fan of the mesh aesthetic that is becoming the current rage. I like my airflow to not be quite as much in your face and I've managed to get great airflow in this case that I will detail more below.

All the white was exactly what I wanted.

It's very quiet when the fan hub is set up properly.

All the USB connectors on the front. I use front panel USB a lot and they didn't skimp on connections here with two 3.0, two 2.0 and one USB-C.

Excellent cable management options.

Drive options out the yahzoo and a rare 5.25 device mount area if you must.
Cons: While the fan hub is great, the instructions for using it are quite sparse and need more explanation than the included manual provides. (See below.) The manual itself could also use a bit more exposition though it is a cut above the manuals for the other cases I've used.

It's also a long case. It has to be to provide all of its configuration options, but it's something you should be aware of. Be sure to measure the space it's going to be occupying.

The design of the top filter clashes with the design of the airflow focused top cover. I bought the white case and I wish the filter were black instead of white, then the top would look better when using the optional top cover and the observer would not notice the clashing design. (I wonder if I can buy a replacement filter in black?)

The included fans are 3 pin DC instead of 4 pin PWM fans.
Overall Review: I've been building systems since 1988 and this is hands down the best case I've ever used. I seem to collect different cases and in the past year I've also used the Lian Li Lancool II, the NZXT H200, and the Be Quiet Purebase 500. Those are all good cases for those on a budget, but this more premium case is hands down superior.

I chose not to use the vented top cover and left the solid one on. I reconfigured to storage mode (Something you don't need to remove the front fans to do in spite of the instructions to do so.) I removed the bottom hard drive cage and put two 140mm fans in the bottom pulling air into the case. Since I configured to storage mode, the two plastic panels on the PSU shroud were removed leaving a large opening for airflow from the bottom mounted fans.

The use of the fan hub requires a bit of explanation. The manual recommends you plug it into either the CPU fan header or a chassis header. I plugged mine into a chassis header since I didn't want all the fans spinning up when the CPU fan did. With my Ryzen 5 3600 short quick temperature fluctuations are the norm and I didn't want to hear all my fans compensating. Since I don't have any PWM connected to the hub, software doesn't see the case fans. I did have to go into BIOS and switch from PWM to DC for the chassis fan header, otherwise all fans will run at full speed. Now it's all very quiet.

My CPU cooler, the Arctic Freezer 34 ESports Duo, has it's PWM fans connected to the motherboard CPU header. This case configuration has great airflow and my temperatures dropped 11c at idle and 9c at full load compared to the Be Quiet case my system was moved from.

In the modding potential department, there's a lot to like here as well. For instance, I added an LED strip mounted underneath and at the front of the shroud. This provides beautiful edge highlights in the cutout design and is much more subtle than all the unicorn puke you see these days. Also, in storage mode, you have this wide flat area near the glass that has so much potential for customization. I've not done any yet, but I'm planning something interesting there.

I hope I've covered everything important. Bottom line, I highly recommend this case. It's amazingly versatile and engineered.

I love the look of it, especially without the side glass panel, as it just disappears into the room without screaming ""gaming pc"" while vomiting RGB lights all over my room. Overall really happy I spent the extra money on this case over something cheaper.

I have only put together a few towers, so I'm still relatively new. This tower was by far the easiest to open, install my motherboard into and swap things around.

Cable management was smartly laid out, and had several built in velcro ties, and I only needed to use one zip tie.

Very solid construction and easy to understand how to open/close every section.
Cons: Had one screw that was beyond tightened and I worried about stripping it to get it out. Minor inconvenience.

I didn't like having to take the front panel and fans off to get to the extra drive mount.

Everything is high quality. Good cable management in general. Supports many configurations. Doors and panels and how they latch are fantastic. In general, this is the perfect case for me, and the cons list below is quite nit-picky.
Cons: My top panel came damaged, and there is a part that is really pointy and sharp because of it. I'm going to have to see if I can get a replacement top panel somehow. I would have liked the PWM hookups on the top of the case to be closer to the front instead of the back. The USB 3 front panel cable is very thick, and almost caused my motherboard port to bend because of how tight it was getting it through the cable management hole. Documentation in general is great, it would be nice to explain more about what is possible with each configuration (example, server build means you cannot place a 140mm fan on the top where the panel that holds drives gets moved to. Just a little hard to tell from docs, but easily seen if you have the case in front of you.). Hard drive slots were a little difficult to get mounted and only have 3 points of contact, but they seem OK at least for now.

Paint quality
Overall Review: I'm running with four 140mm intakes, with 2 on the front and 2 on the bottom, and three 140mm exhaust, rather than stock fans. Still extremely quiet.

The biggest difficulty was using the hard drive sleds. While they have catches that should facilitate alignment, I often found the thumbscrew to be misaligned after I had inserted the rear catches. The uneven spacing between the thumbscrew holes made this even more difficult.

Also, the paint the screw threads and holes came off in small flakes as I was moving pieces of the case around, coating my fingers and leaving residue on my table.

- Build quality is extremely solid
- Case is modular and easy to take apart - this made the build process so much easier
- Included front I/O is unmatched - few cases have this many ports at the front
- HDD caddies work well to soften vibrations
- No frills with RGB lighting and non-tempered glass option - Fractal doesn't force you to pay extra for features you don't need
- Included fan controller is a great addition (plugs into PWM header for three included DC fans)
- My case arrived with two bent HDD caddies, but Fractal support was awesome and took care of replacements immediately
Cons: - Price is higher than the Define R6, but you are definitely getting more for your money; I would say the price increase is definitely worth it
Overall Review: This case is great for professionals who value silence, accessible/modern I/O, and storage space. For gamers and everyday users who don't need hard drives, I would have a harder time recommending this because it's much larger than other cases on the market.

Cons: I don't particularly like the inclusion of the built-in fan controller. My motherboard has a CPU and six system fan connections. The case comes with three fans.

- Fans are high quality
- Good acoustic design, machine is quite even under reasonable load
- Cable management was easy
Cons: - This is a mid-tower case only in the sense that the maximum motherboard size is ATX. This thing is huge and heavy.
- 3.5"" hard drive mounting options seem sloppy. After converting the case to ""storage mode"", there's two drive slots that feel solid, and the other drives go on floating inserts with only three points of contact. Several of mine came bent. I can feel a small amount of give in the trays after installation, which can't be good for drive life.
- The PSU shroud sits very close to the bottom of an ATX board, making connecting your front panel a real pain. At this price, I expected a small little ""pin out"" device to connect the front panel through that would slide onto the MB header as one piece. No such luck.

Can be disassembled very easily. Case is very deep, so it can hold a wide variety of heat sinks. Good cable management if you have ATX sized motherboard.
Cons: Absolutely cannot use cable management port holes if you use a full size E-ATX motherboard. Have to open the bottom access ports which limits mounting points for pump and reservoir.

It is advertised as E-ATX compatible but don’t get this if you have an E-ATX board. It’ll fit just not be able to use any other features touted about this case.

Fans are quite loud and not PWM. For a premium case I would have expected more.

Cons: -5.25"" drive bay is either a lie or not compatible with all drives

-Bad instruction manual
-Multi-bracket can't really be used for a 3.5"" drive(safely at least)
-Converting to storage mode can be frustrating
Overall Review: Update 6/22/2020:

I've decided to subtract an egg because of complications arising from the multi-bracket. This bracket, despite what the manual said, should not be used in any capacity to vertically mount a 3.5"" drive. The drive I mounted to that bracket began making very audible straining noises thanks to gravity - which, to be fair, I suspected would happen even before they did - soon after installing it. I had to convert to storage mode a couple days ago because of it, which was its own ordeal thanks to a design choice. The screw on the inside that you have to tighten after converting to storage mode is annoyingly short and located in a cramped space too small for normal screwdrivers, making it hard to tighten. That task took up the vast majority of the conversion process for me, but I'm glad I did the switch in the end. I was able to stop using that hard-drive cage from my original review and I should have plenty of options going forward for easy replacement of storage. Word to the wise, though: if you have more than one traditional HDD and any intention on owning a longer video card, you might want to look at other cases. Otherwise, this is still a good case with glaring weakness; just a few more than I initially noticed.

Original:

I would technically give this case a 3.5/5 eggs because some of the frustrations I've had with it outweigh the parts I'm happy about. It is a good case, and spacious enough to handle a CPU Cooler like the Noctua NH-D15 in 2 fan mode even with ripjaws memory(barely, though, so I would still suggest smaller clearance ram if you want to use both fans). The customization on it is great. The PSU shroud is nice. Even the fan hub, which some purchasers have talked down about, is fantastic for boards like mine that have a limited number of fan headers.

But there are some glaring weaknesses for this case as well. First of all, one of the reasons I picked it was because it mentioned having a 5.25"" drive bay. Sadly, that was either a lie or it's not compatible with my ASUS DVD drive that I took from my previous computer. Try as I might, the screw holes for the ""5.25 drive bay"" didn't match up at all with the drive it was supposed to fit. My drive is not that old, so I highly doubt specs have changed enough in the last 4 years to warrant that incompatibility; and, not to mention, that drive bay is precarious at best since it only screws in on one side. Use at your own risk.

Another nitpick I have relates to the 3.5""/2.5"" drive cage in this thing, which is okay for the top slot but a royal pain in the *** for the bottom one. I recently had to pull out a hard drive from this case because it was failing under warranty, but unlucky me had placed it in the lower slot when first putting it in. The screws, which I had put in just the way the manual showed me, were stuck out just enough from the bottom of that tray to catch on the bottom edge of the rear panel when removing it. I even tightened those screws as far as I safely could and they still got caught. In the end, I had to unscrew the whole drive cage from the bottom so that I could lift it up enough to get the drive out. That is bad design and there are no excuses that I can accept for it.

And speaking of the manual, that thing is incredibly unhelpful. It is picture after picture with no words or descriptions in English other than titles and table of contents. Good luck if you're not a visual learner, cause I guarantee you're not going to have a good time using this thing the first go around.

Overall, while I like this case, it has some glaring weaknesses that I can't overlook. If you have just one HDD, a couple SSDs and no need for a 5.25"" drive, go for it. You won't be sorry. Otherwise, be prepared for some potential problems during installation.

- Top components, multiple layouts, HDD/SSD/server layout is a godsend for anybody with lots of drives
- Everything ships nicely organized.
- Lots of screws included. The rubber grommets for the drive sleds are great and a necessity for HDDs
- Nice to see a case that still has a 5.25"" bay
- USB-C port on the front is great
- Dual config top for vents/rad or noise reduction
- Plenty of holes/slots/ties for cable managing
- Fan control at the top is nice, although makes tucking cables very tight
Cons: - Manual is pretty weak, even the online one is just the manual in pdf. You can figure it out, but a better one would've sped up the process.
-Some of the screws that are already in case that you have to move for mounting stuff strip the white paint when you remove them, I'm guessing they were just overly tightened on assembly at the factory. Kinda stinks when you are building and you have metal shavings everywhere off a few screws that are also in danger of being stripped due to being too tightened.
- The case fans included are NOT pwm fans, just regular DC despite there being a fan controller

Not going to dock any points off for, but slightly disappointing for these things considering the price

Also worth nothing, that because it's such a big case, it's a tight stretch for 24-pin & 8-pin from the PSU to the board if you don't have a long enough cable/non-modular PSU. Luckily mine made it tightly, possibly something to keep in mind for those before they purchase.

Also if your board doesn't have a USB-c port, then the front is of course useless, so you may have to spend a little more on a 2-port board to really maximize the front i/o, since most boards usually only have 1
Overall Review: Overall, still one of the best cases out there, I can only image what the XL model is like. Very robust for different configs. I used it for many HDDs, but used the sleds and removed the drive cage on the bottom for better airflow. You are getting your money's worth on material and build quality.",0.0,8.0,8.0,3.0,5.0,1,1,1

Cons: You can't buy extra drive sleds anywhere even 6 months after launch. What good does it do to have all this room, but not enough drive sleds. Fractal, take my money, just give me more sleds.
Overall Review: Very good case with lots of room and options. Better than the define r6 in many ways. If you want lots of drives and a DVD Bay in a good looking case, this is almost your only option.

Overall Review: Fantastic case! I'm coming from a Define R5 and there are some significant upgrades. I will never buy a case other than Fractal Design. They understand how to design cases. I put a MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk Wifi motherboard in it and everything went great. I appreciate that there is an option to put an optical drive in it. I watch blu-rays, burn blu-rays, and also burns CDs. Optical Drives are not an option on so many other cases these days. Airflow is decent with stock fans though adding a fan to top pulling out really improved it significantly. I'm using a Noctua NH-U14S cooler. I wish there was mesh door option. This would really improve airflow. I open the door while gaming. I was considering a Meshify S2 but optical drive is not an option and front panel has 2 less USB ports.",0.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: This case was for my workstation, and I'm very pleased with it. It's pretty, easy to work with, silent, has plenty of room : very good product overall. I didn't used the fan hub, because I wanted more control over my fans. I plugged them directly to my motherboard. Would certainly recommend to a friend if they can afford it.

I think the case might be quieter than others because of dampening material on the back panel and the front door.
- The finished build is very clean and cables can be routed nicely.
Cons: - The case is rather heavy for its size, which makes it a bit difficult to push in and out from under a desk if there is carpet. It would be great if the case had wheels.
- The front panel USB cables are quite stiff and the slot where the cables enter the main compartment is located very close to the USB socket, making if very difficult to plug the front panel USB cables into an ATX motherboard. It would be easier if the cable slot were located a few mm farther from the motherboard.

Cons: heavy without electronics installed
heavier with electronics installed
Overall Review: Where do I start. I thought about getting the XL version but I'm glad I didn't. This case is very big. I do see the benefits of such room because it was very easy to install everything after the first item, the motherboard. Before I realized there was no removal of the motherboard tray I thought, well, this will be interesting to deal with, yet the top comes off to give ease for video card, CPU heat sink, RAM and everything else to install.

I opted to install the heat sink base after securing the motherboard. The cutout behind the motherboard is very large so It gave me no trouble securing it. Cable management is easy to deal with, and allows for them to be hidden behind the motherboard mounting deck.

Black. Did I mention the word ""black?"" Everything in and on this case is black. Cables - black. Outside - black. Motherboard standoffs - black. Rivets - black. Front panel buttons - black. I love black so I'm more than satisfied and surprised at the all of the black this case has.

- Seemingly great features

- Having to refund/return the case because I didn't read the fine print on this thing, I guess. Newegg or Fractal Design needs to remove ""E-ATX"" from this case if it won't actually hold those boards.
Overall Review: I couldn't give you a yes or no on the case. It seems like a nice case from all the reviews, but not actually being an EATX board is frustrating from my personal perspective.

The modularity of this case is fantastic. The ease of removing the panels, reconfiguring it to/from storage mode, etc. are all a wonderful part of this case. The multiple top panel selection that's included is also great.

The ability to mount bottom fans is also a huge plus for me and something you don't see in nearly enough cases, in my opinion. And then there's the built in fan hub (See also Cons) and all the room to do whatever you want.

The lack of front panel mesh is, to me, a huge plus. I'm not a fan of the mesh aesthetic that is becoming the current rage. I like my airflow to not be quite as much in your face and I've managed to get great airflow in this case that I will detail more below.

All the white was exactly what I wanted.

It's very quiet when the fan hub is set up properly.

All the USB connectors on the front. I use front panel USB a lot and they didn't skimp on connections here with two 3.0, two 2.0 and one USB-C.

Excellent cable management options.

Drive options out the yahzoo and a rare 5.25 device mount area if you must.
Cons: While the fan hub is great, the instructions for using it are quite sparse and need more explanation than the included manual provides. (See below.) The manual itself could also use a bit more exposition though it is a cut above the manuals for the other cases I've used.

It's also a long case. It has to be to provide all of its configuration options, but it's something you should be aware of. Be sure to measure the space it's going to be occupying.

The design of the top filter clashes with the design of the airflow focused top cover. I bought the white case and I wish the filter were black instead of white, then the top would look better when using the optional top cover and the observer would not notice the clashing design. (I wonder if I can buy a replacement filter in black?)

The included fans are 3 pin DC instead of 4 pin PWM fans.
Overall Review: I've been building systems since 1988 and this is hands down the best case I've ever used. I seem to collect different cases and in the past year I've also used the Lian Li Lancool II, the NZXT H200, and the Be Quiet Purebase 500. Those are all good cases for those on a budget, but this more premium case is hands down superior.

I chose not to use the vented top cover and left the solid one on. I reconfigured to storage mode (Something you don't need to remove the front fans to do in spite of the instructions to do so.) I removed the bottom hard drive cage and put two 140mm fans in the bottom pulling air into the case. Since I configured to storage mode, the two plastic panels on the PSU shroud were removed leaving a large opening for airflow from the bottom mounted fans.

The use of the fan hub requires a bit of explanation. The manual recommends you plug it into either the CPU fan header or a chassis header. I plugged mine into a chassis header since I didn't want all the fans spinning up when the CPU fan did. With my Ryzen 5 3600 short quick temperature fluctuations are the norm and I didn't want to hear all my fans compensating. Since I don't have any PWM connected to the hub, software doesn't see the case fans. I did have to go into BIOS and switch from PWM to DC for the chassis fan header, otherwise all fans will run at full speed. Now it's all very quiet.

My CPU cooler, the Arctic Freezer 34 ESports Duo, has it's PWM fans connected to the motherboard CPU header. This case configuration has great airflow and my temperatures dropped 11c at idle and 9c at full load compared to the Be Quiet case my system was moved from.

In the modding potential department, there's a lot to like here as well. For instance, I added an LED strip mounted underneath and at the front of the shroud. This provides beautiful edge highlights in the cutout design and is much more subtle than all the unicorn puke you see these days. Also, in storage mode, you have this wide flat area near the glass that has so much potential for customization. I've not done any yet, but I'm planning something interesting there.

I hope I've covered everything important. Bottom line, I highly recommend this case. It's amazingly versatile and engineered.

Cons: No hardware brackets were included for the 5.25"" drive bay.

The front USB ports seem weakly mounted and have an uncomfortable amount of give in them when plugging a device in.
Overall Review: If you don't need a 5.25"" bay, this case will be perfect. Even with that minor issue, as other people have noted it's a dream to work in and took very little time to transfer the parts into it from the other case I had.

Overall Review: Really solidly built case. I was surprised at the weight of it when I first lifted it. Quality components throughout, and totally silent even when I am gaming. If the room is quiet and I pay attention, I can hear the PC under heavy loads, but even at that point it's still quieter than my ceiling fan or the noise out my window.

I love the look of it, especially without the side glass panel, as it just disappears into the room without screaming ""gaming pc"" while vomiting RGB lights all over my room. Overall really happy I spent the extra money on this case over something cheaper.

One thing to note, it's larger than I expected it to be, but my PC sits under my desk so that's a non-issue for me. People who want to display their PC on their desks might want to see it in person before buying.",0.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1,1,1

I built a Gigabyte Aorus Master, i9-9700 with a Noctura NH -U14S cooler in this thing and it runs super cool and everything fits nicely. I highly recommend this case.

Everything is high quality. Good cable management in general. Supports many configurations. Doors and panels and how they latch are fantastic. In general, this is the perfect case for me, and the cons list below is quite nit-picky.
Cons: My top panel came damaged, and there is a part that is really pointy and sharp because of it. I'm going to have to see if I can get a replacement top panel somehow. I would have liked the PWM hookups on the top of the case to be closer to the front instead of the back. The USB 3 front panel cable is very thick, and almost caused my motherboard port to bend because of how tight it was getting it through the cable management hole. Documentation in general is great, it would be nice to explain more about what is possible with each configuration (example, server build means you cannot place a 140mm fan on the top where the panel that holds drives gets moved to. Just a little hard to tell from docs, but easily seen if you have the case in front of you.). Hard drive slots were a little difficult to get mounted and only have 3 points of contact, but they seem OK at least for now.

Overall Review: I'm running with four 140mm intakes, with 2 on the front and 2 on the bottom, and three 140mm exhaust, rather than stock fans. Still extremely quiet.

The biggest difficulty was using the hard drive sleds. While they have catches that should facilitate alignment, I often found the thumbscrew to be misaligned after I had inserted the rear catches. The uneven spacing between the thumbscrew holes made this even more difficult.

Also, the paint the screw threads and holes came off in small flakes as I was moving pieces of the case around, coating my fingers and leaving residue on my table.

- Build quality is extremely solid
- Case is modular and easy to take apart - this made the build process so much easier
- Included front I/O is unmatched - few cases have this many ports at the front
- HDD caddies work well to soften vibrations
- No frills with RGB lighting and non-tempered glass option - Fractal doesn't force you to pay extra for features you don't need
- Included fan controller is a great addition (plugs into PWM header for three included DC fans)
- My case arrived with two bent HDD caddies, but Fractal support was awesome and took care of replacements immediately

- Fans are high quality
- Good acoustic design, machine is quite even under reasonable load
- Cable management was easy
Cons: - This is a mid-tower case only in the sense that the maximum motherboard size is ATX. This thing is huge and heavy.
- 3.5"" hard drive mounting options seem sloppy. After converting the case to ""storage mode"", there's two drive slots that feel solid, and the other drives go on floating inserts with only three points of contact. Several of mine came bent. I can feel a small amount of give in the trays after installation, which can't be good for drive life.
- The PSU shroud sits very close to the bottom of an ATX board, making connecting your front panel a real pain. At this price, I expected a small little ""pin out"" device to connect the front panel through that would slide onto the MB header as one piece. No such luck.

Cons: Absolutely cannot use cable management port holes if you use a full size E-ATX motherboard. Have to open the bottom access ports which limits mounting points for pump and reservoir.

It is advertised as E-ATX compatible but don’t get this if you have an E-ATX board. It’ll fit just not be able to use any other features touted about this case.

Fans are quite loud and not PWM. For a premium case I would have expected more.

-Spacious

Cons: -5.25"" drive bay is either a lie or not compatible with all drives

-Bad instruction manual
-Multi-bracket can't really be used for a 3.5"" drive(safely at least)
-Converting to storage mode can be frustrating
Overall Review: Update 6/22/2020:

I've decided to subtract an egg because of complications arising from the multi-bracket. This bracket, despite what the manual said, should not be used in any capacity to vertically mount a 3.5"" drive. The drive I mounted to that bracket began making very audible straining noises thanks to gravity - which, to be fair, I suspected would happen even before they did - soon after installing it. I had to convert to storage mode a couple days ago because of it, which was its own ordeal thanks to a design choice. The screw on the inside that you have to tighten after converting to storage mode is annoyingly short and located in a cramped space too small for normal screwdrivers, making it hard to tighten. That task took up the vast majority of the conversion process for me, but I'm glad I did the switch in the end. I was able to stop using that hard-drive cage from my original review and I should have plenty of options going forward for easy replacement of storage. Word to the wise, though: if you have more than one traditional HDD and any intention on owning a longer video card, you might want to look at other cases. Otherwise, this is still a good case with glaring weakness; just a few more than I initially noticed.

Original:

I would technically give this case a 3.5/5 eggs because some of the frustrations I've had with it outweigh the parts I'm happy about. It is a good case, and spacious enough to handle a CPU Cooler like the Noctua NH-D15 in 2 fan mode even with ripjaws memory(barely, though, so I would still suggest smaller clearance ram if you want to use both fans). The customization on it is great. The PSU shroud is nice. Even the fan hub, which some purchasers have talked down about, is fantastic for boards like mine that have a limited number of fan headers.

But there are some glaring weaknesses for this case as well. First of all, one of the reasons I picked it was because it mentioned having a 5.25"" drive bay. Sadly, that was either a lie or it's not compatible with my ASUS DVD drive that I took from my previous computer. Try as I might, the screw holes for the ""5.25 drive bay"" didn't match up at all with the drive it was supposed to fit. My drive is not that old, so I highly doubt specs have changed enough in the last 4 years to warrant that incompatibility; and, not to mention, that drive bay is precarious at best since it only screws in on one side. Use at your own risk.

Another nitpick I have relates to the 3.5""/2.5"" drive cage in this thing, which is okay for the top slot but a royal pain in the *** for the bottom one. I recently had to pull out a hard drive from this case because it was failing under warranty, but unlucky me had placed it in the lower slot when first putting it in. The screws, which I had put in just the way the manual showed me, were stuck out just enough from the bottom of that tray to catch on the bottom edge of the rear panel when removing it. I even tightened those screws as far as I safely could and they still got caught. In the end, I had to unscrew the whole drive cage from the bottom so that I could lift it up enough to get the drive out. That is bad design and there are no excuses that I can accept for it.

And speaking of the manual, that thing is incredibly unhelpful. It is picture after picture with no words or descriptions in English other than titles and table of contents. Good luck if you're not a visual learner, cause I guarantee you're not going to have a good time using this thing the first go around.

Overall, while I like this case, it has some glaring weaknesses that I can't overlook. If you have just one HDD, a couple SSDs and no need for a 5.25"" drive, go for it. You won't be sorry. Otherwise, be prepared for some potential problems during installation.

Overall Review: If you have to question why someone would need 32GB in Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit then you're not using your computer at its full potential.

If you're looking to future-proof your rig for the next few years, this is how you do it.
- At least when it's on sale, it's priced almost linearly with smaller quantities of RAM.
- It's faster than the great majority software demands, though I stick to gaming -- not high end multimedia development.
Cons: You'll note that none these cons are Corsair's fault.
- Software will still find a way to eat through 32gb. (for instance, I think BF3 has a memory leak -- luckily it requires nearly 8 hours of continuous play on one server to affect this RAM!)
- Requires Windows 7 Professional or greater to use all 32gb. Most Linux flavors will probably also be fine.
- Many motherboards still seem to not recognize it's 1600mhz RAM. My Gigabyte motherboard didn't, nor did an earlier reviewer's ASUS.
Overall Review: Now (mid-2012) might be the best time for 32gb if you figure in diminishing returns. (for a sense of how I judge diminishing returns, I got an i5 because the i7's didn't seem to offer much extra bang for the buck) You'll be well ahead of the mainstream for years, which means even abhorrently written software won't give you grief, and it'll be awhile before the price plummets.",0.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,40.0,1,1,1

You will not have to worry about it, no matter what program you are using. These are a matched set, and that is why the price is just a little higher.

Overall Review: Good chance that you will have to set your timings manually for this, XMP profiles may or may not work. Realistically the voltage is 1.5, but you may have to set it for 1.6 or so. Also to take advantage of this much memory, you will need Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, or Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.

This is the only 32g kit certified by Gigabyte.

No complaints at all about the quality of the memory or compatibility.
Cons: The heat sinks on these chips are VERY TALL (as I state in the title). I'm taking an egg off for the sheer height of the heat sinks. In fact, there was no way I could install these on the motherboard with the Noctua NH-D14, regardless of which way the heatsink is pointed.

Pointing with the airflow out the back of the case, the right side tower of the Noctua overlaps two of DIMMS. If you install the Noctua exhausting upwards, the right side of BOTH towers overlaps the two inner most DIMMS.

I ended up mounting the Noctua venting upwards and cutting off the bottom three rows of fins from the outside of both towers. This seemed to be the least offensive option as mounting the Noctua the other way would have required removing a lot more of the fin surface area.

I'm taking an egg off of the rating because of the obscenely large heat spreaders and the fact that there really isn't any configuration that I could come up with where the CPU heatsink would fit unmodified.
Overall Review: I don't know if the extra tall heat sinks on this RAM are necessary because of the chip density, but expect there to be interference with just about any large CPU heatsink.",0.0,3.0,4.0,13.0,40.0,1,1,1

After I updated the bios, it still showed as 1333, and I set the goal speed of the ram to 1600, it is now at 1605MHz and 9-9-9-24 timing! Which rocks IMO after the initial heart attack of not posting (i7 3930K and the X79 and ram add up fast!)
Cons: They are tall, and will interfere with heatsinks of the larger variety (TPC 812). But, on the LGA 2011 platform, you can mount the cooler in any direction, and now it is pulling air across and blowing it across all for sticks for better airflow on the ramsinks.

Overall Review: I figured I would buy these for my dual-channel motherboard so when I upgrade to a quad-channel I won't have to rebuy memory.

Unfortunately, this seems to have gone downhill - the BIOS reports it running at 1333MHz and I can't safely speed it up, while most software I use incorrectly rates it at 667. Not sure why this is.

Is Corsair not testing these at the factory???
Overall Review: not sure if its a problem with this RAM or my motherboard, but BIOS initially set these at 1333 clock rate (even though it correctly reported the XMP 10-10-10-27 1600MHz info from them). Easy enough to make the BIOS change, so no big deal.

Overall Review: What is with manufacturers that overhype their memory like there is something special about it? The XMP ""overclocking"" profile is nothing more than a PC12800 (1600) 10-10-10-27 profile. Big deal. Stock Dell RAM comes that way. What's with the BIG heatsinks? The RAM isn't going to get warm or hot at these timings. And the fact that I have to have XMP enabled just to get 1600 timings is ridiculous. This stuff (at this price) should default to 1600 and XMP gives 1866 or more.

Cons: The memory or the board did not recognize it at 1600 speed at first. I saw people had the same issue so I went into the easy to use bios and upped it to 1600. Also the sticks are a touch high so be wary of the fan you get with it because it might not fit with 64GB of sticks.
Overall Review: The cons aren't really cons, I still love the memory. I now wish I had gone with a liquid kit that had minimal obstruction directly on the board due to the way my MB, memory sticks and CPU cooler all fit.

Cons: For the past decade I've been a very happy Corsair customer. Never had a problem using a number of their enthusiast-grade memory modules, that is, until I bought “Corsair Vengeance Black 32GB 4X8GB DDR3-1600.” The system booted and Windows installed without apparent problems. The first thing I noticed was that I couldn't sleep or hibernate at all. The only time that sleep worked, waking crashed. Because I had started playing with overclocking my 3930K, I suspected it was my overclocking that was unstable.

MemTest86+ showed an error at a specific memory region. It was at around 31gb point. Since this was consistent with stock settings and even while underclocking, I suspected one of the dimms was bad. Changing their places gave the same results. After spending over 3 weeks trying to tune the CPU and RAM settings, I started suspecting it was the motherboard. I moved 1 dimm at a time from a dedicated channel to another, and eventually narrowed the issue down to Channel C. So all 4 dimms were works fine in triple channel mode, but never in quad. I had heard of issues with the P9X79 motherboards, but being an equally old and happy customer of Asus that it was mostly the users' fault.

I ended up replacing them.

"Wavlink USB 3.0 to SATA Hard Drive Docking Station with Card Reader and 2 Port USB 3.0 Hub, External Enclosure, For 2.5/3.5 inch HDD/SSD SATA I/II/III, One Touch Backup/UASP/SD & Micro SD",64.0,4,34.99,Reed M.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,4/13/19 17:34,4.0,"Pros: Both the card reader and disk interface work fine so far. I've used it to re-purpose some old 3.5"" spinning drives for backups. Crystalmark showed 100MB/s sequential read and write, which is as fast as those disks were going directly to SATA. UAS works out of the box with both Windows 10 and Linux. U3 SD cards also perform as expected.

Having the card readers and hub is a nice bonus if you have limited USB3 ports. There SD and micro SD slots are separate card readers, so you can use two cards at once, unlike some multi-adapters where the two slots are wired to the same physical interface.
Cons: The cord is a bit short (under 3 feet) to comfortably have the device on a desk with the computer on the floor.

Un-mounting a SATA disk in windows is kind of awkward, since ""safely remove"" only lets you eject the entire device, and as far as I can tell you have to power the device off and on to get it back. This is probably mostly down to how windows handles composite devices, but it makes the hub less useful for keyboard, mouse or network plugged into the hub. You can eject SD cards individually using right click -> ""eject"" like normal.
Overall Review: I actually ordered a different product (with just the drive bay) so I was surprised when it showed up with card readers and a USB 3 hub. The seller eventually sent an explanation that was ""due to the upgrade and maintenance of our backstage"", and I have no complaint at all about a free upgrade on an already well priced product.

Under linux, the device shows up as a GenesysLogic hub , ASMT ASM105x SATA interface and two generic USB card readers.

Overall Review: I purchased this ""docking"" station instead of a WD My Book or Seagate Backup external hard disk. The main reason is because I wanted to choose the drive to use (WD Red) and therefore avoid typical ""green"" or other power saving drives that we usually find inside those units. Another reason is that I can easily upgrade the disk in the future and/or swap the drive within seconds. Ok ... as stated in the cons, note that the supplied USB cable is barely 3 feet long, so unless you plan to use the docking right next to your laptop or PC, you'll need a longer cable ! The power adapter cable length is very limited as well ... Also take note that both the USB ports and the SD card slots on the front are not detected when the docking is turned OFF. Now, as soon as you turn it ON, you will see 2 new drive letters in Windows Explorer (one for each SD Card Slots) and they'll stay there as long as the unit is ON or until you remove the USB cable connected to your computer (even if both slots are empty). When you have a SATA Hard Disk or SSD in the dock, one more drive will appear in Explorer for a total of 3 drive letters ... If you connect a USB key on the front, yet another / separate drive will popup ... Overall I'm very satisfied with the unit ... Regards, Daniel :-)",0.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,15.0,1,1,1

Cons: - Feels like cheap plastic
- Front panel coming off the base (Possibly due to poor shipping but with one reviewer reporting the same issue I'm reluctant to believe mine is from the same cause)
-Died after just under a month of usage.
Overall Review: I've only owned the product for 2 days, however I can agree with one previous reviewer about the case coming apart due to a possible shipping problem. I ordered this with the thought that maybe mine would be shipped with no issues... this was not the case. That's the reason I gave it 4 eggs instead of 5. Because although the product seems to be fully functional, I had to add some superglue on the side to hold the front on.

-Update 03/29/2019
Died. When attempting to transfer information the computer completely freezes up. I know it isn't the cable because I am using the same cable with another usb 3.0 dock with no issues. The sad thing is I can't return or replace it due to the fact that the original packaging was discarded already. Can guarantee everyone I'll never purchase this product again.",0.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,15.0,1,1,1

It could have used some sort of directions as how to use it once it was plugged in. Manufacturers seem to expect everyone to know how to use them. And it would not take much to get them started.
Cons: The old drive had to much space in the front and back causing it to wobble. But I folded some napkins and put in front and back and we were ready to go to work. Cables could have been a little longer but I made do. When you turn on the DS two screens pop up. One is for the old drive and one is for the new computer. Find the symbol in the screen for the old drive and click on it. In my case it was gateway. Then find the symbol for the new computer in the other screen and click on it. In this case it was hp laptop. Once were ready I opened the photo file in the gateway and also in the laptop screen. Then it was a matter of clicking on a photo and dragging it to the new laptop. I had kept my photos separated in to separate files. And in that case I just clicked on the file and drug it over. And so I followed suite with the rest of files. It took quite a few hours but it was worth it. I had made backups but on the same laptop. I will not make that mistake again. And I believe there is a way just to copy a lot of material over. But I could see what was happening and it worked well with me. I also had time to clean up the drive and not carry over things that I just did not need any more. Good luck to all.
Overall Review: I would recommend this product and more like it. It made a nice clean job and I have saved a lot of information. Now I could use this with a new drive to backup my new one.

Small footprint.
Two USB 3.0 Type-A plugs(use it as a hub)
Easy push button on-0ff switch
Cons: Hub is not powered if the dock is turned off.
Overall Review: I needed a dock for my 8 TB drive that I use to store my System Images and archive my data to. The dock accepts 3.5 or 2.5 inch SATA drives. Just drop them in. It comes with short USB type-A to USB type-B cord. The USB 3.0 input is a Type-B incase you need to have a cord that allows you to place it more than 3 feet away.

It has two USB 3.0 Type-A plugs so you can use it as a hub if you are short of USB ports. The only problem is that the hub ports are only active if the dock is turned on. So if you want to turn it off when you have finished writing or reading from it, which is what I do to insure that my backed up data can't be compromised if I am hit by a ransomware attack, the hub ports will not work.

I did not try the One Touch Backup feature. It does have both an SD and Micro SD slot. It only accepts one SATA drive at the same time, so you can't use it as a RAID device.

It does what it should. For the price, I can't knock it for the hub not being active when it is turned off as that would require the circuits to be separated and then it would cost more, and you can just pull the SATA drive out if you need the hub and want to use it as I do. So if that issue isn't a problem for you, then it deserves the 5 Eggs.",0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,15.0,1,1,1

It takes a while for the hard drive to start up. Not a big deal, but takes maybe 20-25 seconds for it to show in Explorer. My other docks are pretty much instant when powering up.

The hard drive is a bit difficult to insert, maybe this will get better with use. I would leave my backup drive inserted most of the time, so not a big issue.

RGB looks just as good and works with all the major board RGB software.
Cons: Wish it didn't have T-FORCE painted at the end of the RGB strip.
Overall Review: I was worried about how well this would run on Ryzen, but memory seems to work much better after BIOS updates and/or newer chipsets. I think this looks just as good as the GSkill Trident Z in another build and the RGB is just as vibrant. Its no Samsung B Die CL 14 RAM but it was also half the price!",0.0,4.0,4.0,9.0,33.0,1,1,1

Cons: The XMP profile (3200) might not be stable, and it isn't likely the fault of your CPU/motherboard. The first set I received (labeled 3200) wasn't stable above 2933; my RMA replacement kit is stable at at least 3333 (limited by my Ryzen 2600s IMC, ultimately). This is bizarre, as they are labeled identically and as both are Hynix C-die (CJR), as confirmed with Thaiphoon Burner.

Secondly, the ""Blitz"" software (notably, still in ""beta"" stage, a year later) is simply an old and outdated reskin of Asus Aura; don't use it. Instead, use the latest edition of Aura, which is evidently buggy and generally terrible software:

-""lightingeffect.exe"" is detected by certain games' anti-cheat tech as cheat software, and you'll have to task manager close it in order to get these games to run (e.g. Far Cry 5)
-certain effects draw nearly 5% of my 2600 (at 4 GHz); this is constant, and doesn't cease unless ""static"" or default (""rainbow"") are selected
-even if the PC is properly shut down, on reboot into Windows, if ""default"" (rainbow) was previously in use, the sticks will not light up again until I go into Aura and reselect ""default."" (This is obnoxious and inexcusable.)
-many more problems I haven't yet discovered, in all probability
Overall Review: Never assume that your motherboard and/or CPU are to blame for unstable RAM at advertised specifications; the first kit I received was unstable above 2933, while the second is stable at 3333 (with significantly lower timings, across the board). Make sure the XMP profile (at minimum) is stable, and if it isn't, get a replacement kit that is. Don't use ""Blitz,"" which is simply a reskinned Asus Aura of old, and expect problems with Aura (as indicated above).

This aside, for the money, it's a great value (if you get a kit that works as advertised, that is).",0.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,33.0,1,1,1

- It stands VERY high. My initial plan for my build was to top mount my radiator (Case is a Meshify C and my cooler is a Celcius+ S24 Dynamic), but because the RAM is long length and height wise, I didn't have enough clearance.
Overall Review: - Overall, I really like the product but I'm probably gonna end up replacing it. It's a shame because the sticks themselves look very good, but because I can't top mount my radiator, I'm also unable to use the 140mm fans that I got and GPU clearance is kind of sketchy.

Cool black shielding on the sticks, the clear topped sticks have BRIGHT RGB lights that can be controlled with Aura Sync, and obviously they run at great speeds.
The only this to aware of this kit is that these sticks are taller than most RAM kits I have seen due to their design, just be sure that you have clearance for your CPU cooler and other components especially if you're using a Micro ATX or ITX for factor.

- Great battery life.
- Good sound quality.
- Small, rugged case for everyday carry.

- Only one side can be used for ""single usage""
- No Wireless charging.
- Micro-USB charging port.
- The case can't stay standing up, you either need to put it on the side or keeping on the ""back"" which will make it ""roll"" a little.

Cons: My main disappointment is that it is advertised as if it comes with a 2 yr warranty even though it is refurbished, but in reality all of their refurbished products are 180 day warranty. This is not stated in the ad at all, you have to go to their website and find it there. I feel a little cheated because the 2 yr warranty was the biggest reason for my last review.

Jabra Elite 65t True Wireless Earbuds,40.0,3,49.99,Anonymous,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,4/7/20 7:29,2.0,"Pros: There ear buds have excellent overall reviews across many different reviewer websites and look great. The refurbished warranty is 180 days according to the paperwork in the packaging NOT two years as stated on newegg's website. Newegg did a great job handling the RMA process.
Cons: The right ear bud worked with no issues. The order included two sets of brand new ear seals as well. I checked and they even had the latest firmware version installed. However, the left ear bud only worked intermittently. It was solid when located within 1 centimeter of the right ear bud. However, when I moved it where my left ear is actually located, it would cut in and out.
Overall Review: A quick search of reddit showed the left ear bud disconnecting problem is fairly common. Returned for a refund as it seems like this problem should have been caught during the refurbishment process before reselling the ear bud as refurbished.",0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,22.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I have the ASUS GL702ZC, came with 1x 16gb Samsung memory. However there is a pretty significant CPU bottleneck when running in single channel. I gambled knowing this is a different fab than the one I already had, but they play nicely together.
CPU benchmark went up 1000pts in Timespy, and gained an average of 15fps in Grand Theft Auto 5. 32gb of RAM in a laptop seems overkill but we don't know what the future holds. Worked out well since Asus locked the BIOS so there's no memory configuration so can't use higher than 2400mhz frequency RAM.",0.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,34.0,1,1,1

We would like to help you to reach the advertised speed on your build.
The memory speed can't reach 3200, it might not just because of the compatibility problem with motherboards.
CPU version will also limit the memory speed, i.e AMD Picasso CPU only up to 2933 for memory speed even you use 3200 memory.
Please contact our Tech support and kindly provide the report from CPU-Z software.
This can accelerate the process of solving this issue.

G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3600 (PC4 28800) Desktop Memory Model F4-3600C16D-32GTZRC,31.0,5,169.99,Shanon S.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,2/10/20 14:01,5.0,"Pros: Works perfect with Asus aura sync, run at rated overclock speed straight from XMP profile no adjustment necessary
Overall Review: I could not get my four sticks of 8 G Skill Ripjaws V to run at the rated 3600 speed. I wondered if it was just too much for the memory controller to handle within four separate sticks. Popped these in and my Asus ROG Crosshair Hero VII immediately recognized them and set the XMP profile and they run 3600 no issues at all. Aura Sync picked them up and matched the LED color to the rest of my system. What more could I ask for?",0.0,8.0,8.0,9.0,12.0,1,0,1

Efficiency
Cons: None for me
Overall Review: I am using this on a new Ryzen 5 3600x overclocked. It replaced the AMD Wraith cooler. The stock cooler worked at keeping the processor at a an even temperature at idle and doing regular computer work and internet browsing...when playing some of the games it would kick into high gear and get quite loud...even at which it would get warmer than I was comfortable seeing my new R5 get.

The Deepcool Gammaxx 400 cools very effectively at idle and non intense usage...the fan is barely audible it is at such a low rpm because the cooler fins are really working well. Under load of gaming the fan speed kicks up only a bit...maybe 60%-75% max speed but it isnt nearly as loud as the AMD cooler was and keep the processor even on the temp...I dont remember the numbers off hand. I'll be building another PC with an R53600x if I remember I'll get data for the AMD Wraith cooler, purchase another DC Gammaxx 400 and write a review for that one.",0.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,1,1,1

Cons: A little tricky to install if you are replacing the stock heat sink and fan, but it's not too bad.
Overall Review: I'm very pleased with this purchase. My desktop has an AMD FX-8150 in it, and it has run hot for a long time. When it's hot, it gets loud, and the computer has shut down a few times due to heat. Annoying, and as we all know will limit the life of the CPU. So I tried this little guy and it has exceeded my expectations. Heat no longer an issue, system runs much quieter, and Newegg had a very good price on it.
If you are replacing an existing heat sink and fan (as I was) you'll have to take off the old bracket which will require you to have access to the back of your motherboard. It's a little bit of a hassle, but not too hard, and well worth the effort if your system is running hot.
I highly recommend the product.

Cons: Not a con but something to be aware of. The cooler works well because of its size and the size of the fan. Great for an ATX case , not sure about smaller cases.
Also you will probably need to remove the mounting system your motherboard came it’s and use DeepCool system. Easy enough to do though so it’s not a con and you get terrific results.

Cons: the only con is if you use on a matx its real close to the memory which can be fixed by putting fan on other side and flipping fan over to pull. wasn't really a con it you know what your doing. but if they can make the fins just a little higher would fix the problem.

Sorry to hear that you are having difficulty installing this unit. The AM3+ has a plastic support piece on the motherboard. You would need to remove that bracket to install this unit. The 4 screws that holds that plastic support piece to the motherboard is where the holes that the backplate would need to line up with.

It works with the Altice One brand router and connects to 5g properly where some other extenders would not.

It runs nice and cool where another repeater was running quite hot.
Cons: 5ghz download speed does not reach peak speeds but I think this is do to the fact it is middling the signal the router. On a 100 Mbps connection I was getting about 80 Mbps which is still quite acceptable to me. Upload speeds remained the same which is nice.
Overall Review: I would recommend this product. I had it up and running in about 10 min and it works with 5g on my Altice One router where some other Wi-Fi extenders and repeaters would not. Although it does not reach total peak speeds the connection is smooth and acceptable by far. Upload speeds remained constant with our without the extender so that was a plus.

It was a breeze to configure and although I did not check out many options it does what I need it to do and that is extending my Wi-Fi 5ghz and 2.4ghz ranges with little effort on my part.

It also runs cooler than another repeater I tried. Cool to the touch where the other one was quite hot.

I would have had to go from my router into the attic and to the target location cutting holes in the ceiling. This affordable range extended solved the problem. I just plugged it in, connected to the router, and that provided me with enough WIFI to handle my tasks. I can now view everything I need to see on my iPad, phone, and laptop. The speed is incredible. Setup was relatively easy. A great product at a great price for those that need WIFI anywhere.
Cons: Why I gave it 4 stars out of 5. The reason is because, despite having a powerful up to date router, This model range extender kept loosing the signal. I had to tweak it several time for it to continue to provide the adequate WIFI needed in a continuing stream without lose of connection. I had to rely on outside help to do this after several attempts. Maybe a more powerful range extended would have eliminated this.

Overall Review: The signal is stronger than the trifling original doorbell extender , and finally got the video doorbell working with the Wavlink. The signal is consistent. The color LED indicating signal strength is nice. Pay close attention to the WPS instructions; unlike most I held it a bit long and never would connect. After waiting minutes, I rebooted it and it said it was connected. So before you use the paper clip, see if it's actually connected.

Update: it went out in a few months and there was only a 90 DAY warranty! I've looked now and Wavlink doesn't stand behind their junk like other manufacturers do. Check warranty before buying; it's not worth it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,23.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I purchased this in January of this year, it never really seemed to enhance the signal a whole lot, but it did manage to get the wifi to the back rooms. I initially installed it, passing through two walls. That left it with the red LED mostly, so I moved it closer to the router, giving me a blue LED. It has worked quite well until this week (June 21) Now it will not send out a signal of a good enough quality to connect to and the LED stays red. Time to replace it with a different brand, hopefully one that will last longer than six months!

UPDATE:

Well, after I left for work, my wife decided to try some things, she pressed the tiny reset button on the bottom with a paper clip and also reset the router, which had been working, maybe they needed to sync up again, any way, the extender is working once again, the light is blue and the wife is happy!

Cons: Not really a con, but something to be aware of:
unlike meshes which are designed to extend wifi signals while maintaining a single SSID (network name) and allowing devices to transparently switch to the nearest, this device is a simple extender which works best if it has its own SSID. When moving around the house, you will have to manually disconnect and reconnect to the nearest network.
Likewise, this device cannot use the same SSID for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks and auto-manage connections.
Overall Review: If you are ok with the above cons and you just want an inexpensive way to extend your network, this device works really well.
If the cons are not acceptable, there are some router-extender mesh packages out there which are more feature rich and automatically manage connections on a single SSID. They make usage of the network much easier, but can be a lot pricier.",0.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,23.0,1,1,1

I have basically had them running non stop for the past three weeks and not once have I noticed any issues or a moment of the colors cutting off.
Speed is as expected for DDR4 3000.
Cons: Although this cons section is much larger than the pros, it should not take away from the quality of this product. My only Con is that there is no software for this product if you do not have an ASUS motherboard. The ASUS sync that the product recommends is a BIOS driver that is not comparable with any other motherboard. For those of us that have motherboards of a different brand, I would recommend a different product. Without the software the RGB on these simply run through a rainbow of colors with no set pattern or design. For my build, this actually works out pretty well, but for those that have a specific color scheme in mind and a motherboard brand that is not ASUS, I would recommend venturing elsewhere.
Overall Review: Although I would recommend this product to others, I would do so with the caveat that if they do not have an ASUS motherboard, to venture elsewhere.

Will update as rig is built in. So far so good. Arrived with a ding in the side panel. Seems well made. I like the magnet mesh on top, and side glass panel. I grew up thinking you didn't want magnets anywhere near computer parts, but maybe that's outdated and I'm just old. Only thing aside from the ding I don't like is the front panel is solid. There's space between interior fans and the panel (approx. 1 inch) so we will see how air flow is when up and running. Like that it comes with a double ring RGB fan on the back, which will match my Gamdias AIO nicely. Compartments for PSU, your old HDDs and wire management look adequate.
Cons: Only thing aside from the ding I don't like is the front panel is solid. There's space between interior fans and the panel (approx. 1 inch) so we will see how air flow is when up and running. If you're hype for RGB you won't see them on the front fans, but it does have that strip built in. Being able to see the fans by making the front panel mesh (or glass) would really take this case to the next level.
There's holes for the interior mounting panel that have been machined from the outside (right) to the inside (left) and those holes are pretty sharp if you run your finger by them. They could machine that down with a dremel easy to avoid any cuts/pokes.

You can open it or take it off quite easy with no screws to worry about.
- Great cable management
- RGB light is a little brighter than in the pic, which is a plus. I was not aware RGB could actually look like a rainbow. I thought those pics were always misleading edits!
- Fan is quiet
- Plenty of room for fans, even though they are useless
Cons: - RGB fans runs off a controller. Controller does not connect to motherboard RGB headers, only to the power supply. Slight ""pro"" is that the buttons on the case control the fan and case lights, but big ""con"" that it won't sync to your motherboard's headers (so no AURA sync). Controller is a small, magnetic hub that sticks to the inside of the case. That is also a small ""pro"" in that you can put it wherever you want.
- If you want fully sync'd fans and case lights, you have to buy proprietary Rosewill RGB fans that ONLY work with this case. I don't understand their rationale for going this route.
- Horrible air flow is the reason for the 1 star review. The front fan slots are useless. They have less than an inch of space. Front of case is solid, so no air getting in. It has to pull from the vertical slits on the sides of the front bezel. You won't get good airflow from the front, and if you try, you'll be sucking in unfiltered air. Magnetic, removable filter is on top. Who wants to pull air IN from the top? An inch from the rear exhaust fan? Let's say you use the front fan slots as intakes. If you don't fill up all three slots with fans, it would leave empty space and your intake fans have a greater chance of just pulling in air that's already in the case. 3 fans won't be able to push or pull enough air through the vertical slits on the sides.
- If you try to mount a radiator in the top, the screws will push the magnetic filter up and you'll have 4 or 8 bumps that ruin the look of the top of the case. There's not enough room to easily mount a radiator up top. Ram and CPU get in the way (yes, even the watercooler base on the cpu got in the way, it's CLOSE). I had to reverse the fan direction and pull air through the radiator to get some semblance of balanced airflow.
Overall Review: Don't buy just because of the air flow issues. I'm going to watch the temps and if it gets too hot, I'll just get another case and use this for a home server with a low-watt cpu. The only acceptable method for airflow in this case is two fans: included fan for rear exhaust and purchase a 140mm intake fan in the top fan slot closest to front of case. Not at all good for a water-cooled system.

This could have been solved with mesh/grated front bezel with filter on the inside.",0.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,26.0,1,1,1

Anything else and it goes downhill from there. The RGB really looks good and I wonder how long they can last considering the extreme thermal cycling going on within the confines of a PC chassis, not that mine is small (hafX).
Cons: Disappointed with the OC ability as I was coming from a LPX 2400Mhz which did 3000mhz just fine at cl16. This thing is basically at its limits already. Funny thing is that mention of Ocing is stated on the lpx box whereas not on the rgb pro, which just mentions the ""stunning lighting"" and ""stability"". Yeah, whilst their website says how overclockable the rgb pro is. Looks over performance (ie: oc-ability) for this one.

The second gripe I have is the one everyone has, ie: false advertising re the timings. If it were 18-19-39 I would be able to push this thing further if I loosened the timings a bit.

The last gripe I have by far is the fact that upgrading from a 3000 to this (3700mhz), didn't yeild any FPS gains for me whatsoever after benchmarking 5 games... Pretty bummed, but it may be improving the low 1s and 0.1%s and I have no idea how to find that out.
Overall Review: The price difference between my lpx and this rgb pro was $54. That's a lot of money for some RGB lighting. Until I figure out if my 1% and 0.1% lows have actually improved, this might just be a very expensive cosmetic upgrade till then.",1.0,0.0,6.0,3.0,4.0,1,1,1

- Fast read/write speed
- one cable that handles data and power
- easy to plug and play for more mobile gaming
Overall Review: I had sworn off mechanical drives a few years back, and did not think I would consider anything but SSD. Newegg had an impressive sale offer for the WD_BLACK P10 Game drives. The storage to price was better then any HDD, or SSD. The read/write speeds were very good for a usb external storage unit. My last mechanical HDD was a WD Black 5TB internal drive that served me well until it started to report SMART failures. So I took a chance and bought one.

Overall it is a great external HDD. It comes pre-formatted as an ExFAT format. I considered a reformat to NTFS, but found most suggest the ExFAT for better plug and play usage. Crystal Disk test report a average read/write of 125MB/s compared to the advertised 140MB/s. This speed put my WD BLACK 5TB internal HDD to shame which only averaged 105MB/s. I copied my hefty library of games, about 3TB, over from my secondary SSD. This took about an hour, and had no errors. I then tested a few games. Loading does take a bit more time, but gameplay does not suffer much.

I would definitely suggest the WD_BLACK4TB P10 Game HDD. I may not use it for my desktop often, but it is a good backup. I may also use this for my gaming laptop that has a OEM 1TB SSHD. The internal drive does okay for running the OS, but games do not run smooth. When I connected the WD_BLACK P10 Game Drive and played some games it was far smoother when run from the external drive. So another good usage if your internal laptop storage is small, slow, or both.

A small negative. I had hoped to take the drive out of the external case for use internally in my desktop. I was able to find a Hex Key small enough to remove the outer case bolts, but the cover would not come off. The top cover is inset, and I can only assume not designed to be user serviced. Just a minor let down. I slightly doubt I would see much better performance by installing it to a SATA 3 connection.",0.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1,0,1

For a USB driven portable 4T hard drive this is an awesome product. I always wanted to have a portable copy of all my games for my laptop. While some load times may take some time compared to your NVMe laden desktop ( I was ok with it; after all it's an external HDD ), there was no impact while playing AAA games. No skipping, no stutter, nothing!
Yes, it can be used as a backup drive, but it's functionality deserves to be more than that. During games copies I was getting up to 160 Mb/s. To me, that is extremely respectable ( I was ok with it; after all it's an external HDD ) .

- Very decent read/write speed. ( I was ok with it; after all it's an external HDD ) .
- Stays warm, not hot; no issues after continuous 6 hour writes.
- Very portable; 2.5"" drive.
- Case looks great.
Cons: Slight con. Would like to see USB C to USB C. Time to let Micro USB B go.
One odd thing:
This now on three devices. Sometimes when plugged in, a drive warning comes up and would like to scan the drive. When scanned no errors.
Thought maybe reformatting to NTFS, comes as exFat, would solve the issue. Still the same.

It was fast enough to allow game play while it was connected to the old one but after the internal drive was wiped. This showed me that I could use this as a direct link for the games to be played.

Fast transfer rate and easy operation.
Cons: There was a approximately 300GB of data on the drive before starting the data transfer. I'm not sure what that encompasses or whether that is just the formatting for X-box one. I'm glad I got the 3T size!
Overall Review: I have multiple WD My Passport drives which is what led me to believe I could trust them for the game data as well. Having is for the X-box one specifically makes the not so techy side of my more comfortable since I didn't want to run into lagging game play.

It only took about 3 Days to arrive (with Free Shipping!) and was super easy to use and install. The device also came with 2 months of Xbox live Gold!
Cons: One of the only drawbacks of this device is that the USB cord is really short, but this isn't really much of a problem since you just plug it in and leave it there. Just try not to leave it on top of ur Xbox because it will get hot. You also only get about 4.5 TB of usable storage in total but it should be more than enough for most people!
Overall Review: Overall everything is working fine and I have room to spare for new titles along with older titles I was dying to replay.

- Looks great.
- XPG software is easy to use and works.
- Decent price for an NVMe 1TB RGB SSD.
Cons: - As of April 20', still having issue with Armoury Crate(AURA Sync) making the performance plummet when sync is enabled. When sync is enabled, I get near SATA SSD speeds... It's awful. However, the lights do sync with the rest of the system.
- Runs somewhat hot under full load in my system(65c), and that's without the RGB lights enabled.
Overall Review: Seriously disappointed that the issue with Armoury Crate hasn't been resolved yet. I made sure that I had the latest BIOS/drivers/software, but it still drops performance when sync is enabled. This is not a fault of the SSD itself, it has something to do with the Armoury Crate software.

Cons: -Doesn't Sync up with Asus RGB control
Overall Review: For the price these are good drives with a good capacity to performance ratio. Have not noticed any overheating issues, the RGB cover seems to make use of the metal in the middle as a decent heat spreader. My Asus x570 board does not seem to recognize the drives in the RGB control, however, the rainbow effect is not too bright to take away from the overall color effect I have. Will check and see if ADATA has drivers or software for RGB control later and update. The other posters have had the smaller drives, I have 2 of the 1 TB drives and the read speed is around 3400 each. The ADATA site said ""up to"" 3500, and I imagine that is for the 2tb drive. Due to the way SSD data is handled, the larger drives would be faster than smaller drives. I did not raid them, as I'm using a ramdisk for faster game loading anyway. No sense making a system more complicated than necessary just to save a couple seconds loading up the ramdisk.",0.0,3.0,4.0,,,1,1,1

Easy install
Good speeds
Cons: RGB. It looks decent, definitely has hot spots though. I can look at it an tell that there are 8 LEDs. I have an ASUS MoBo. In order to sync the LED to my system I had to download their software. Once I did that Aurora was able to pick up the M.2. BUT.................................................
After I did that and ran a bench mark test, the SSD failed miserably... I'm talking like 5th percentile failed. Speeds dropped like crazy. My 2.5"" SSD was out performing the M.2 by A LOT. I uninstalled the RGB software, did a reset and the SSD performed above expectations.
Overall Review: I had a major shipping issue. I live in the midwest, the company is in California. The SSD shipped from CA and landed in Boston, Ma. Where it took the shipping company to move it 90miles in the course of 48ish hours. I wrote the company and recommended never shipping with them again. The company reimbursed me for the troubles caused from shipping. No questions, no issues, no concerns except for making the customer happy.

In short, good company and good product. Its a shame that I cant exactly sync the rgb with the system without sacrificing performance, but I will definitely do business with ADATA Technologies again. Nothing a little software patch cant fix for the RGB.",0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1,1,1

-RGB light look cool, even if you can't do much to them. They are bright for sure
-fast.. will deliver easily over 2000GB on write.. on first pass 55GB initial run.. then slow down to sata speed beyond that.
Cons: -Product is being pushed beyond its capability...
-Poorly engineered thermal design.
Heat .. this product is poorly engineered from thermal design. It has heat sink but the product gets to 70 degree Celsius at idle. Start copying some data and this thing will easily go past 95 degree Celsius before literally dying.. meaning drive will not longer function. You will need to wait for it reach normal temperate before windows will see it again.. if a circuit isn't already dead from the high heat...
Overall Review: Dead drive in 10 min flat.
Steps to dead drive.
1. Installed the drive second m.2 slot on gaming laptop
2. Started to copy games folder from another m.2 drive in the same laptop (185GB steam games folder on second drive)
3. Middle of copy job, the operation stops.. reason is drive is not responding..
4. The RGB light have stopped. A quick touch on heat sink, almost burns my hand. check with temperature gun and it sitting at 96 degree Celsius
5. Shutdown and wait for it cool down. Reboot the PC, it comes back but again any large copy operations kills the drive.
6. check online, looks like I am not the only who has experienced this behavior.
7. Check the idle temperature on this drive and my temperature gun shows it is sitting at 70 degree celius when idle.

Conclusion: Buyer beware.. The light maybe cool, but this is product has poor designed thermal setup which should have never been released to market by Adata. I guessing the business manager likely overrode the engineering telling him we need to reduce the thermal on this thing.

End result. I have now sitting on useless product and will have to wait another 5 days for different SSD, and ofcourse all the effort to return this unit. My trust in Adata produts is officially dead after I had positive experience with their SX8200 Pro. Unlikely I am going ever recommend Adata based on this flawed product.",0.0,8.0,20.0,,,1,1,1

Overall Review: This is a great little NAS. It is serving all of my current purposes rather nicely, with plenty of power for future uses. One thing I'd like to note...NewEgg has this NAS listed as 2.41 Ghz which would indicate that it is a dual core processor. This is incorrect.

Since I had an older QNAP NAS, the setup for what I wanted to do was easy. After using the drive for several weeks, it became apparent that the capabilities of this NAS was far beyond what I would ever have any need for and this is why I gave it 5 eggs. Could be the last NAS a home user would need to buy.
Cons: To take advantage of capabilities of the NAS requires advanced understanding of networking and the operation of a server. Be prepared to spend time to learn to properly and securely set the drive up.

The interface is beautiful (Linux) and it barely uses any CPU when streaming 1080p movies to the Roku 3s via PLEX. I can't even think of any cons.

Cons: Upgrading the memory could have been easier. A better start up document would have been nice.

I also wish they had included instructions on snapshots. It just started making one and it used up the rest of my disk space. Easy to fix, but some warning would have been nice.
Overall Review: I finally upgraded my Iomega (Now Lenovo) NAS. The speed and features have jumped light years past what my old NAS had.

The synology quit working when the temps only got down to the 40's in the room i have it stored in and well i guess that was enough for it,. I have a sneaky suspicion it couldn't handle the cool WD Red drives i had in it and couldn't spin them up when they went standby. This one been running been running over a year and working good. I think this qnap has better hardware and the eject drives are nice
Cons: None really, I think the software layout is better than synology and i think these are built more rugged inside and out. I consider Synology to be the Apple of servers and i don't like apple or their software and synologys software is similar to apple.

Stable with two 8GB Crucial 2Rx8 DDR3L 1600 for a total of 16GB RAM - upgraded from single 2GB module it came with.
2. Stable with 10TB WD Reds in RAID 1
3. QNAP has a track record of reliability and a well developed application ecosystem.
4. Personally, I've owned four QNAP NAS devices before this one and all are still running today with no issues.
Cons: Not really a con but they make you write something here so.........I did not encounter any problems other than having to rebuild the storage pool initially created under the old firmware which did not support snapshots to the latest 4.3.x version. This was not a problem for me as I had no data on the drives but if you are upgrading to this hardware using drives out of an older QNAP and want snapshot functionality, you will have to back up the data and recreate the storage pool and data volumes.
Overall Review: This was a good buy for the 270 price point. If you need cache or Qtiering in a 2bay unit, you will want the 253be model but this one has a quad core CPU and easily updates to latest firmware once initially set up. Recommend updating firmware first as I believe any storage pools created under the original 4.2.x firmware circa 2016 did not support snapshots or at least that was the notification I received after initialization and updating to the latest 4.3.5 build. Fortunately, I had some 5TB HGST drives laying around to do the initial update which if going through the setup wizard, automatically created a RAID group and volume. There may be a way of not going through the wizard and updating firmware first but I just decided that since it was RAID1, I should look at some Black Friday HDD deals purchased a couple of 10TB red drives on sale at BB for $179 essentially doubling my capacity and since already updated, the storage pool would now be able to support snaps after the initial sync. If I recall, the initial sync on medium priority took about 20 hours. Hope this helps in your decision.",0.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,81.0,1,1,1

Cons: I'm not sure if qnap actually tests their firmware updates but every update in the last few months has caused a lot of stress. Every firmware update kills my Plex server app and I have to spend days troubleshooting it, re-installing apps, re-configuring my vpn, etc.
Now, the NAS loses internet connectivity daily and I have to restart it each time just to get the networking to come back online. It's essentially become a very expensive paper weight.
I've also noticed that my reset button does absolutely nothing.

This is my fourth NAS and easily the most potent one I've owned.

I bought this to replace a Mac Mini running as both a backup, file and PLEX server. I set aside a few hours to try to figure out how to set up the server to accomplish these tasks and I think I should have devoted even more time to exploring the device's capabilities - it's way more powerful than I expected.

The mobile apps all work as expected.
Cons: The complexity comes with a price. I am not really happy with how any of the functions work; file sharing is inconsistent across the network, user access is confusing and doesn't work correctly, the media server is finicky when dealing with thousands of folders. I'm unsure how to harden the device and having my archives sitting on the network with some level of access (that I don't know how to control) makes me really uncomfortable.

Could I fix this with a few more hours of studying and tinkering? Sure. But I already invested half a day in this thing, and there comes a point where you just want a file server to _work_.

Also it's really loud. Not like server room loud, but loud enough that you'll be asked to move it away from the bedrooms at night.

This may be a fine machine. It just really wasn't the NAS for me.

Cons: Software is a nightmare! You will waste HOURS just trying to get it to do basic tasks.
NO De-Duplication app. Seriously, think about that. You have to clean up dup files manually, and Qnap support says they don't have this most basic storage function. (I did ask them).

Then they will update software and break it. Just trying to play music is a pain in the neck. Their ""media player"" is a pathetic joke, in contrast to everything else that is over-engineered with little value for the trouble. And all I wanted today was to play my music via the browser window (local or web based). Won't play, and demands separate log in that doesn't pull in the other user permissions.
Overall Review: Avoid the pain and the wasted time and avoid Qnap. Sure the hardware seems fine, but their software is so woeful you will pull your hair out. It's a darn shame and I regret buying QNap.",0.0,1.0,3.0,19.0,81.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: qnap has a really nice NAS in theory. build quality is excellent, memory is user upgradeable, QTS and android apps are polished. however, i had many issues. first, hd player would not see my multimedia even though i gave shared folders permissions. hdmi output had interference and had issue with the handshake between my tv several times. i had other issue but i've listed enought to warrant this item a return.",0.0,3.0,14.0,19.0,81.0,1,1,1

Cons: I bought this to replace my older slower QNAP TS-220 which I have been using a few years as a home file server. I wanted a faster CPU to have encrypted shares to protect the data just in case. I also wanted to do backup of that data to external USB disk.
I set it up and it just doesn't work. The backup logs hundreds of times repeating, hundreds of errors and never completes successfully. Actually now it just runs reading the disks over and over and never ends. I've worked with QNAP to resolve this and after a couple of months of trying its still not working. Unfortunately its beyond the return date.
The only feature I am using is CIFS, AFP and NFS shares with backup to external disk. I've tried all the combinations, encrypted, non-encrypted, upgraded firmware multiple times. Had QNAP support on remote desktop session several times and invested a lot of time and hundreds of dollars for something that doesn't do basic functionality.
Overall Review: I would not recommend buying this. Backup to external USB should be a simple basic function of the product. I recommend trying another brand or building an ITX server which should be easy to do at the same price or less.

Cons: -Product arrived with GPU not even assembled into the PCIe port. It looks assembled from the outside, but it's not actually inserted in the port. My guess is that the physical dimensions of the case and motherboard they used were too restrictive for the bulky GTX1660 Super, so that whoever assembled it gave up and just mounted it in a way that made it look connected at first glance.
-Product DOA (dead on arrival) - after connecting the GPU unit myself, and checking other wiring connections, the desktop only had light upon power up, with no display on monitor nor any ""beep boop"" sound indicating function.
-Scratches on case and motherboard on arrival.
Overall Review: The purpose of buying a pre-built laptop is to pay a premium to have someone else build the computer and avoid the hassle of doing assembly it yourself. i don't mind the cosmetic defects (scratches, bends), but to get a DOA product that arrived with the GPU not even installed is an awful feeling.

- Comes with an extra wired keyboard and mouse to giveaway
Cons: - This is pretty specific to my build: The GPU is the Gigabyte GTX 1660 Super which FYI has 3 DP ports and 1 HDMI port. Slight miscalculation for my build as my monitor is only 144Hz capable via a DVI port... which this card does not have. The GPU, and another 512GB of SSD will be the next round of upgrades.
- Couldn't get the DVI port on the I/O panel to work out of the box... Not a biggie, but worth mentioning.
- I disconnected the 80mm case fan since it was more noise than airflow.

Overall Review: First-time Gaming PC buyer here,

I walked through all the instructions to set up the computer only to find out it still doesn’t start at all. I bought a pre-built PC because I am not extremely knowledgeable on the building process, but I am capable enough to follow directions and angrily trudge through troubleshooting tutorials if need be. I was exciting for this to arrive. I was not excited to spend three hours trying to fix it to no avail. I was hoping this PC would arrive before I headed back to college and it did. Just not in a usable state. I’ll be contacting ABS Support tomorrow and with the hopes of either “fixing” it or refunding it.

-PS. In my three-hour haul to start the dang thing up, I believe I stumbled upon the problem(s). The PCL-E wasn’t connected properly (found this out via another DOA review on Newegg) and there is either a problem with the motherboard or PCU shorting as my included mouse lights up fine, but my keyboard doesn’t and, obviously, the PC doesn’t turn on/boot.",1.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,10.0,1,1,1

The Power Supply is hanging off the rear of the case, just like in the product photo. There is an internal formed sheet metal bracket which does not extend far enough out enough from
the side to support the power supply. Therefore the supply box is just hanging off the rear of the case, unsupported, while bending the sheet metal at the same time.
I fixed mine by adding an internal bracket/spacer. It would have been nice if the factory had bothered to do the same. But that would have required additional motivation and thought which clearly nobody on the assembly line seems to have. Pathetic!

The graphics card by Gigabyte works great.
Cons: Kind of stinks to have to buy a wireless drive especially since you need an internet connection to start setting everything up and creating your factor setup backups.
Also, there is now no room for further expansion, so... there's that.
The lights on the case are pointless. I'd have rather saved a buck by not having them at all.
I really didn't need a mouse and keyboard with lights that can't be turned off, so now i have to unplug the computer at night if someone is sleeping in that room.

After unboxing the PC apon arrival, i did a visual inspection of the inside and to no surprise there were several small wires just hanging about not plugged in. so i got all those plugged in to find my data cable not plugged in to the SSD. i plugged that in and tried booting up. Which almost fried my WHOLE board considering the PSU was messed and ended up shorting and causing 3 of the connectors to heat right up and solder themselves together almost catching on fire. i then found a connector that wasn’t ruined and hoped for the best. it didn’t catch fire or heat back up but still black screened with no display. Did more looking around and found the GPU wasn’t even plugged into the board and was missing a clip... i have called numerous times only to be told that another department will have to ‘call me back’ WITH NO CALL BACKS. like literally almost fried my whole PC and even worse almost caught my house on fire with this non inspected Garbage. plus my graphics card is still broken but they won’t do anything about that either.

Overall Review: I'm not even sure I would recommend the product. This was shipped and sold from ADATA themselves, so this is extremely disappointing, and the SKU is only a few months old so it's not like there's a ton of RMA or refurbished ones that should be sitting around. Of course, if I had paid for a refurbished model, I wouldn't care. But I didn't. The box of the product was freshly sealed, there was no mistake of sending a used product.

Overall Review: This was one of the only recommended brands for upgrading my Gigabyte Aero 15x v8 laptop. It came with a single 16gb stick of Kingston RAM, which worked great, but not quite enough for my needs, i.e. video editing, photo editing, coding, gaming, firefox with 100+ tabs open, etc... lol. I read a lot of stories of struggle by others with this laptop who tried to find a second RAM stick that would work with their existing one, some with bad results, and most with mixed results (RAM ran slower, etc). I swapped out the original stick for this pair, turned it on and it immediately booted and fully recognized the new set at full speed and capacity, no problem at all. I am extremely pleased with it!

Other than that, I don't have to many bad things to say about the machine.

Cons: How can a fan make this much noise just at idle?
By the MSI Dragon Center, it's Fan #2....
When it's at 0 rpm, the laptop noise is... what's to be expected.
But when that Fan 2 kicks on, there's gotta be something wrong in there.
Like when kids used to stick a playing card in their bicycle tire to intentionally make noise...

Is this Fan 2 REALLY supposed to be making this kind of noise?
Is that the fan on the 2060 graphics?
This is just.... NO. Unacceptable.
Overall Review: I'll give it the weekend to see if this hot mess of a noisy fan cleans up, but if this thing is going to be this terribly noisy when the main graphics (nVidia 2060) takes over from the Intel UHD 630, there is no way I'm keeping this.
I expected more from MSI. A noisy-fanned graphics card sounding like its bearings are shot already is a no-go.

So far, what constitutes a manual sent with it, doesn't offer any solutions or suggestions.

Overall Review: So throughout the last 3 months, I've been preparing to go to college and needed to start buying stuff that I would need. That's when it came to picking a Laptop when it got a little confusing. Browsing Newegg, I saw many laptops with extraordinarily high prices for specs that didn't really fit at all. It was really baffling to see all that considering that I don't have much money and was dumbfounded on what to get. I needed to get my work done but I also wanted to game a lot as well. Thus, I started my search for the best computer company selling the most affordable and laptop with great specs. I was about to settle on the ROG G531GT0-BI7N6 until I remembered I haven't checked out MSI's laptops. I decided to give it a look and to my surprise, I came upon the MSI GF65. I was dumbfounded because compared to the price of the other one, I was getting an GTX instead of a RTX which is one heck of a deal. Not only that, the GF65 is 1 pound lighter than the ROG I was originally intending to get. I quickly changed my mind and settled on the MSI GF65. I waited eagerly for a whole week and once it came in, I knew that I needed to test the laptop with PUBG so I ran it on max settings. It runs great and Dragon Center does a great job at monitoring the laptops vitals as well. The only worry I had was that the laptop would overheat up to 90 Celsius and over which wasnt a good thing. But I fixxed it by under-volting. It retained the same performance and was a lot less hot. I was impressed by that a well. Also, for only having 8 gigs of ram, it runs great as well. It's commonly said that 8 gigs of ram is not a good idea but that feels like a false claim at this point. Running 8 gigs of RAM feels like a breeze and you shouldn't worry about upgrading your RAM at all. One last thing, I will definitely say that this is a great laptop for college. It's lightweight which is something everyone looks for in technology and its incredibly portable. You get a much better deal with this laptop than buying a Apple laptop in which they rip you off for such low specs. Overall, I definitly recommend this laptop to anyone who wants to buy a great laptop for gaming and work.",1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,6.0,1,1,1

Smaller than my older 15.6 inch laptop
Easily upgrade to two Nvme SSD
120hz monitor
Only tried fallout 76 and average 80 fps on high
Cons: Thermals are so bad on this machine I can't believe it's being sold as is. For the average gamer a laptop should be more or less plug and play. With this model you have to be a power user to address these issues. The main concern is the blower style fans with no ventilation on the bottom. I wouldn't have bought this if I notice that but, it can be fixed.

After getting all the screws off INCLUDING THE 0NE UNDER THE STICKER.....do not pry if that center screw is not out. The back has clips that were difficult to remove. I feel like it would be too easy to break off a clip after some use.
Overall Review: After installing fallout 76 it ran horrible hitting the CPU thermal limits 30 - 40 fps. It hit 95 degrees Cpu 86 GPU so I installed throttlestop and dropped the core and cache voltage by -0.125mV. Started the game now the GPU is hotter at 80 C while the CPU wants to stay at 75C but the heatsink pipes are shared so they equalize at 79 C. I'm getting between 90 - 50 fps(Fallout 76 is a mess)
My next step is to undervolt the 2060 to squeeze out a few more degrees.

Must have apps:
Throttlestop - undervolt CPU/iGpu
Afterburner - Overclock/Underclock GPU and monitors gaming specs like framerate and temps while gaming
Nvidia Inspector - Adjust a broad range of settings per game profile. *This is why you pay extra for Nvidia there's full control*

I played around with the timings, the best I could squeeze out of this ram is DDR4 3266 Cas 21 without bumping the voltages. I might try to push the voltages in effort to get better speeds. Secondly I will probably purchase a replacement kit from a brand I am more familiar with.

Completely destroy the old 290
Cons: Fan speed issues - I had to manually set a fan profile with afterburner, the fan was reporting a 67000 RPM speed, which it cannot do. The zero spin mode was sticking from the looks of it. Temps were hitting around 100c when gaming. (I did not have the OSD on right away, good thing I eventually turned it on.)

Black screening - the card is basically worthless in my gaming/HTPC, HT is one of the primary uses for my computer. The primary monitor has not had issues black screening, but the Epson Home Cinema 5010E, not so lucky. That display is stable with no applications running on it, pull an application window over to it, it might do okay, open a Windows Explorer window and then the display goes completely black until the window is closed or moved back to the monitor. I tested all the cords and it was working with the old 290...

Dyson V7 Fluffy HEPA Cordless Vacuum Cleaner | Blue,10.0,4,199.99,David P.,Ownership: 1 week to 1 month,Verified Owner,5/21/20 5:50,4.0,"Pros: - Fluffy attachment is perfect for hardwood floors. It picks up large crumbs, dust, everything. A terrific upgrade from our DC44 Animal cordless
- Canister emptying process is different but I like how it scraps build up off the filter housing
- Noticeably quieter than the our old DC44

- Lots of useful attachments
- Powerful for its size
- Easy clean-up
- No cords!
Cons: - Battery life? (Hasn’t affected me yet)
- Dust/Dirt canister is a bit small
- On switch is a trigger that gets tough to hold down after a while
Overall Review: NOTE that this version of the Dyson v7 (Fluffy) is designed specifically for hardwood floors. It comes with a “fluffy” main attachment that is designed to be gentle on hard surfaced floors and it does NOT include a carpet-specific attachment. If you’re looking for that you’re better off getting something like the Dyson v7 Motorhead instead which is an amazing product as well. I’ve tried the fluffy attachment on rug and it works, its just way less effective.

I live in a small carpeted room with two pets. There’s a lot of fur to go around and this vacuum does a great job at cleaning it all up. It’s light weight makes it easy to maneuver around tight corners and under furniture. It’s also easy to hold, however to keep the vacuum running you have to hold down a gun trigger while gripping the handle, and that can get tiring after a few minutes. Not sure if there’s a way to toggle it to stay on.

The manual says that the runtime is 30 minutes using the small attachments, 20 minutes using the main roller, and 6 minutes when you switch it to a “max suction” mode. That may me a con for you if you plan on vacuuming larger areas or multiple rooms, but for me I haven’t run into any problems with it.

The canister that holds the dust and debris fills up fast, so you might need to empty it out between rooms depending on how big the rooms are or how often you vacuum.

Compact, easy to set up, and powerful enough for every day computing as well as movie watching via any of the streaming services. Though I didn't, you can mount this to the back of a monitor or TV using the VESA mount.

Because you choose the memory and M.2 SSD, you can have lots of RAM and a rather large M.2 main drive.

If you're even a little handy, it's easy to add the memory and SSD drive. If you're frugal, use a free Linux distro like Ubuntu, and you'll have a fully functional, useful, and versatile computer with a far, far smaller footprint than most computers you can find.
Cons: The option to mount this computer to the VESA mount on the back of a monitor or TV is great, but only if your TV or monitor's desktop stand isn't using it already. Intel should design a bracket that can attach this box to the VESA mount in a way that lets the consumer still use the mount to mount the display to a wall or stand.
Overall Review: If you need a computer to use as a Media Center, for your kids school work or as a regular desktop replacement, Intel's Next Unit of Computing is a great, compact option with enough power to do everything with the exception of high end gaming. The option to mount the Unit to the back of a monitor or TV is great, but only works if you're device is not already using the VESA mount.",0.0,0.0,0.0,11.0,45.0,1,1,1

I decided to order *this* card only because the more widely-reviewed/approved 5600 XT options were out of stock virtually everywhere at the time. I figured the performance can't vary *that* drastically, and I'm honestly not that particular regardless.

On the note of performance, this card certainly puts out. However, and this is a huge however, a card's performance isn't worth much if it's unstable. Which this card is. Extremely. Out-of-the-box settings, clean install on a brand new rig, and this card would crash about every 20 minutes to an hour under moderate load. Want to run a low-settings game on one monitor and watch Youtube on the other? Not with this card, at least not without a lot of headaches.

It took about two weeks of troubleshooting, researching, consulting AMD community members, etc for me to get this thing to run stable, and I'm honestly not even sure if it's actually stable now, just that it hasn't crashed in the last two days. I couldn't even tell you what potentially ""fixed"" it as I've tried so many freakin' things to get it to this point of stability - Although it seems to be a combination of disabling hardware acceleration on Chrome/Discord and only running the card on the silent BIOS settings that did the trick. So, at the very least, if you decide to get this card, don't expect to be able to run it at the out-of-the-box performance BIOS (which is kind of the only reason you'd want to get it anyway). The only reason I haven't returned this forsaken thing is because the box got mistakenly tossed in the bin at some point, so I'm pretty much stuck with this problem child of a GPU.

And the thing is, I'm honestly not sure how much, if at all, XFX or its design for this card is at fault for these issues. The biggest takeaway I've had from this experience is that A LOT of 5600/5700 XT cards have been having these exact same issues pretty much since release, with no clear fix or solution in sight, and radio silence from AMD in regards to these issues. Knowing now what I do about the RX 5600 XT, I can't recommend anyone get one. Apparently it's a complete gamble, regardless of which exact card you get, whether or not it will run stable.

I'll be shopping Nvidia in the future. I've heard that the 2060 KO Ultra is about the same performance for a similar price, without all the driver/BIOS issues.",0.0,6.0,21.0,1.0,1.0,0,0,1

-OSD is easy to use with basic options

-Text is clear for reading, work
Cons: -""FPS counter"" seems to register the refresh rate. Should work if you use Freesync.
-Speakers are functional but that's about it
Overall Review: I moved to this a Dell 27-inch with G-Sync 144hz monitor with the expectation that G-Sync would no longer be an option. Moving from 2560x1440 to the extra wide taxes my 2080 more for sure.
I do notice the difference in refresh rate but the extra width and better color reproduction (almost as good as my Samsung phone after tweaking in the Nvidia control panel) make me pleased with it.
It's marketed as a ""gaming"" monitor, but obviously there are products that place more emphasis on the gaming aspect. I have tested this for Red Dead, Madden, Battlefield 4, and Ori and the Will Of The Wisps. All look great. I'm not that good at FPS games, so the drop to 75hz is not a huge deal. The most annoying thing is how the screen goes off briefly as the game switches HDR off and on, even when I turn up the volume in Windows. This seems to be a Windows HDR issue rather than a monitor issue though, so it's not a factor in my review.",0.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,2.0,1,1,1

Overall Review: I would definitely recommend this monitor to a friend. The monitor looks amazing and bright at any angle with its 2k panel, especially with HDR enabled. My box included a power cable, DisplayPort cable, a Quick Start Guide, and an ""ASUS VIP Member Notice"", essentially a 3-year warranty notice. I work as an editor, so having more space to view the timeline is really appreciated. I also like that this monitor isn't pushed as heavily as a ""gaming"" monitor like so many others, which allows it to have a more professional look along with some unique features. The stand included is sturdy and works well. The biggest issue I have was with color reproduction not being as accurate as I would've pleased. I understand that it's made as a ""gaming"" monitor, not something made for colorists, but I would expect some calibration to be done, I'd even pay extra to have that option out of the box. Overall, an incredible value for what you're getting compared to anything else on the market right now.

Great resolution, awesome brightness and color quality.
Cons: - The speakers are terrible, but I didn't realize it had speakers when I ordered. I switched back to laptop speakers for work/Zoom meetings and calls. The monitor has a headset jack on the back as well.
- The menu ""toggle"" switch thing is weird (like a tiny joystick) and the on-screen instructions don't clearly show what you're supposed to do to navigate the menus. It's kind of a pain to use - but once you get the monitor set up how you prefer, you don't have to mess with it again unless you use the speakers and need to adjust the volume.
- My work laptop is treating this monitor as if it's only got a 29hz refresh rate. I blame my laptop - not the monitor. I'll see if updating some drivers or boosting performance helps. I'll also plug in another laptop with a discrete GPU to see if it has the same issue - in the meantime I still give this thing 5 eggs. :)

I highly recommend, but wait for a price drop if you can.

I'm replacing a 1080p Asus monitor that's less than 5 years old, and it was worth the upgrade! The old monitor had to be at full brightness to compete with some direct sunlight making into the room I'm in, and when at full brightness the monitor just had a white/blue glow and the color quality suffered. The contrast was really bad at that brightness level, and I couldn't find a combination of settings to make it look like the monitors I had at work before the pandemic. This monitor doesn't have that problem, and it looks fantastic right out of the box.

Now I just have to figure out why my work laptop (which is running Intel UHD graphics 620) can't run this monitor faster than 30hz.",0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,2.0,1,1,1

The bios is fairly typical for Asus, if you’re familiar with it should be easy to navigate. Overclocks great, set my 10700k to a modest 4.5ghz, I’m on custom water loop, but didn’t feel the need to go higher even though i could probably get to 5.0ghz it’s plenty fast where I have it set. Set my memory to 2933mhz and adjusted the voltage haven’t had any issues. Great upgrade coming from a gigabyte z170 and 6600k.
Cons: Thought my board was defective at first as I was getting a lot of splash screen freezes upon reatarts, however it was my own fault for leaving fast boot enabled. Had to do the same with my previous z170 board as well not sure why I had forgot about it. As soon as I disabled it I haven’t had a freeze up since. It boots plenty fast without fast boot enabled anyway. My only actual con to this board is the clear cmos isn’t a button on the board or back IO shield, it has the old school short the 2 pins.
Overall Review: Great board and was a huge upgrade for me coming from z170 and 6600k to this board and 10700k. If you are upgrading from a z370 might not be too noticeable of an upgrade. Board is very stable and the rgb is subtle and looks good.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1,1,1

Installing a big air cooler is a real hassle on this motherboard.... I installed one temporarly because I am waiting on my CPU block to finish my waterloop.

Cons: Nightmare to install! USB ports stopped working during Windows 10 Pro installation, doesn't recognize USB memory stick, very confusing user interface. BIOS update downloads from MFGR fail and the ""easy internet update"" fails even when connected via hard-wired ethernet cable.
Overall Review: I have always built my home PCs with ASUS motherboards. I happened to buy this one because it was part of a ""matched PC build"" by Newegg. I was reluctant because I have had bad luck with other brands such as MSI. ASUS boards have always been a flawless installation, and I should have listened to my better judgement.
After taking a few hours to tie all wiring and make all connections (including installing other components), I started to install a clean copy of Windows 10 Professional via a USB Blu-Ray drive.
At the point where Windows asks for ""language"", ""country"" and ""keyboard"" entries, the USB ports stopped working, so I couldn't use my keyboard or mouse AND the data from the Blu-Ray drive no longer transferred to the PC.
I thought that a BIOS update may fix the problem. I tried three times to download from the manufacturer only to have the unzipped file produce data that was unusable by the system. I also tried connecting via Ethernet and using their ""easy update"" on the web - the update consistently hung at 60%!
My previous builds with ASUS boards were flawless....never a problem with installing OS, getting drivers and BIOS updates, and they always performed excellently and consistently.
Buying THIS board is a total exercise in frustration...in addition, AsRock has pitiful web support for their products.
I cannot recommend this board for a new computer build. I am fairly knowledgeable (no expert, though) in building my own PCs and have considered this board a nightmare. Any future builds (including this one - which I'm replacing with an ASUS board) will always be done with the more expensive ASUS boards.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1,1,1
